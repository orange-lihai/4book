Among other things he made plain the mysteries of fire hunting for deer, and this proved a more fascinating sport to Mark than any other. As explained by Frank, fire hunting is hunting at night, either on foot or horseback, by means of a fire-pan. This is an iron cage attached to the end of a light pole. It is filled with blazing light-wood knots, and the pole is carried over the hunter\u2019s left shoulder, so that the blaze is directly behind and a little above his head. While he himself is shrouded in darkness, any object getting within the long lane of light cast in front of him is distinctly visible, and in this light the eyes of a wild animal shine like coals of fire. The animal, fascinated by the light, as all wild animals are, and being unable to see the hunter, stands perfectly still, watching the mysterious flames as they approach, until perhaps the first warning he has of danger is the bullet that, driven into his brain between the shining eyes, permanently satisfies his curiosity.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 14, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      Wakulla, A Story of Adventure in Florida    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Kirk Munroe", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/80.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        50,919      ", "iid": "80", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//80/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Munroe, K.
