{"section_text": "\n\tBabbitt's virtues as a real\u2013estate broker\u2014as the servant of society in the department of finding homes for families and shops for distributors of food\u2014were steadiness and diligence. He was conventionally honest, he kept his records of buyers and sellers complete, he had experience with leases and titles and an excellent memory for prices. His shoulders were broad enough, his voice deep enough, his relish of hearty humor strong enough, to establish him as one of the ruling caste of Good Fellows. Yet his eventual importance to mankind was perhaps lessened by his large and complacent ignorance of all architecture save the types of houses turned out by speculative builders; all landscape gardening save the use of curving roads, grass, and six ordinary shrubs; and all the commonest axioms of economics. He serenely believed that the one purpose of the real\u2013estate business was to make money for George F. Babbitt. True, it was a good advertisement at Boosters' Club lunches, and all the varieties of Annual Banquets to which Good Fellows were invited, to speak sonorously of Unselfish Public Service, the Broker's Obligation to Keep Inviolate the Trust of His Clients, and a thing called Ethics, whose nature was confusing but if you had it you were a High\u2013class Realtor and if you hadn't you were a shyster, a piker, and a fly\u2013by\u2013night. These virtues awakened Confidence, and enabled you to handle Bigger Propositions.

Now they were men and women of the world, very supercilious men and women; the boys condescended to Babbitt, they wore evening\u2013clothes, and with hauteur they accepted cigarettes from silver cases. Babbitt had heard stories of what the Athletic Club called \"goings on\" at young parties; of girls \"parking\" their corsets in the dressing\u2013room, of \"cuddling\" and \"petting,\" and a presumable increase in what was known as Immorality. To\u2013night he believed the stories. These children seemed bold to him, and cold. The girls wore misty chiffon, coral velvet, or cloth of gold, and around their dipping bobbed hair were shining wreaths. He had it, upon urgent and secret inquiry, that no corsets were known to be parked upstairs; but certainly these eager bodies were not stiff with steel.

With his other faculties blurred he yet had the motorist's gift of being able to drive when he could scarce walk; of slowing down at corners and allowing for approaching cars. He came wambling into the house. If Verona and Kenneth Escott were about, he got past them with a hasty greeting, horribly aware of their level young glances, and hid himself up\u2013stairs.

For the moment his head was clearer but when he moved about the bathroom his calculations of distance were wrong, so that he dragged down the towels, and knocked over the soap\u2013dish with a clatter which, he feared, would betray him to the children. Chilly in his dressing\u2013gown he tried to read the evening paper. He could follow every word; he seemed to take in the sense of things; but a minute afterward he could not have told what he had been reading. When he went to bed his brain flew in circles, and he hastily sat up, struggling for self\u2013control. At last he was able to lie still, feeling only a little sick and dizzy\u2014and enormously ashamed. To hide his \"condition\" from his own children! To have danced and shouted with people whom he despised! To have said foolish things, sung idiotic songs, tried to kiss silly girls! Incredulously he remembered that he had by his roaring familiarity with them laid himself open to the patronizing of youths whom he would have kicked out of his office; that by dancing too ardently he had exposed himself to rebukes from the rattiest of withering women.

Well, it's up to the folks that do a little sound thinking to make a conscious effort to keep bucking these fellows.

Then if that don't work, the G. C.
