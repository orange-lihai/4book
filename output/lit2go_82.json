Natural ability being equal, the young teacher who has a year or more of professional study has a decided advantage. This professional study gives clearer ideas of school and higher ideals of what should be accomplished.

There are a few examples of such teachers and such teaching. The person and the opportunity met, but in many, many cases, in fact, very few cases has the worthy person and the worthy position for such person come together. President John W. Cook, in an address a few years ago, in commenting upon this lack of opportunity, thought it the duty of the community to increase the salary until we could have the best teachers remaining continually at the same school or neighborhood. This sounds plausible at first. It would seem strange, however, to see a man of President Cook's caliber content to continue to teach in the same district school where he began.

The rougher element of boys and the more careless of the girls may take pleasure in the teacher's discomfort. Such things try the mettle of the teacher. If he is made of the right material and has good judgment, he will come out all right. If he is naturally a coward or if he is full of egotism and conceit the pupils may soon lead him a merry chase.

Systematize your work and work regularly and intensely, but do not encroach upon your hours of sleep unless you want to pay the penalty with interest. Let me say here parenthetically that if all teachers had a fair knowledge of shorthand, enough to enable them to record their own thoughts and to read their own notes readily what a saving of time it would mean in the preparation of their daily work.

I began teaching in an ungraded school, and am glad that at the end of two years I left it as well graded as many city schools. The schools of that county are now well graded, much to the advantage of education in the country. Two of my best teachers were bitterly opposed to the grading of the country schools. They fought it in institutes, associations and at every possible opportunity in conversation. One of them taught long enough to be converted and see the error of his way, the other never did surrender, quit teaching fifteen years ago, and thinks the world is badly out of joint. The grading of country schools is coming, in fact, is here in some form except in the most primitive communities. It is the common sense plan, it is practical, it is efficient.

When we read in our geography that the United States raised two and a half billion bushels of corn a few years ago, it makes no impression on the mind. Have pupils figure out how long a procession of wagons would be required to haul it, counting twenty bushels to the load and twenty feet of space for the wagon and team. How many times would this procession reach around the earth at the equator? The result may surprise you unless you have figured on it, and I am sure it will surprise your pupils. At least it will help them in some little measure to grasp the enormity of the corn crop. Then what becomes of all this corn? Another fact that can be graphically illustrated is to have the class figure out how many tons of water fell upon the school building last year. You can find the average rainfall for your state or locality. A cubic foot of water weighs about 62 1/2 pounds. Then figure out the number of tons.

{"section_text": "\n\tThere will be certain local standards that you should respect if you can do so conscientiously. I have taught in neighborhoods where dancing and card\u2013playing were considered long steps toward everlasting perdition. The teacher who had gone to a public ball or dared dance at a private home in the community would have been met with a storm of opposition. In fact, it would have been almost as bad as if she had gotten drunk. In such communities a teacher would do well to avoid such amusements, and if she is skillful she need not commit herself upon the matter. Leave the people to guess her real sentiment on these things. On the other hand, if the teacher has been taught to regard dancing, card playing and kindred amusements as wrong, and then teaches in a community where such things are common she need not indulge in them. With an ordinary share of discretion she need not give offense in declining invitations to such amusements should they come. She cannot as a stranger do much in one or two terms toward changing the sentiment of the community either for or against such things. After long acquaintance she can build up her circle of friends where other amusements take the place of these that are under ban. Even in time she might create a tolerance for such indulgences, but it is likely to cost more than it will come to. More real good can be done by looking pleasant, and taking no real active partisan part in either way. For my own part I can see no sin in a quiet, civil game of cards. But my mother's puritanical views forbade such as if it were Satan's certain snare. Out of respect to my mother's memory I have never learned the names of the different cards in a deck, and unless I simply applied my own judgment of the meaning of words could not tell one card from another. I lost pleasant evenings occasionally during my university course because of this \"narrowness\" as many called it. Occasionally now, I must decline an evening out or else be a drag to the entertainment feature. I have never offended any one so far as I know, nor lost their respect and good will by refusing to take part in a game. The sacred memory of my angel mother who died when I was a child has far more than compensated me for all the pleasure I have lost. For the other person, I can see no harm in a quiet game of cards ; for me to break my boyhood promise and later resolution would not only rob it of all pleasure but would be a positive personal loss.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 10, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      Twenty Talks to Teachers    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Thomas E.

We fail often in the newer education because we neglect drill and re view, but there should be life in the work, not mere marking of time and perfunctory repetition. Nowhere is drill more necessary than in number work, and yet this drill need never drag or become uninteresting. One of my fourth grade teachers had done good work in the mechanical part of number work. Her class had been accurate and rapid, and I had allowed them upon several occasions to challenge other rooms. In fact they had done well the foundation work in numbers so essential to good work in arithmetic in the upper grades. To test them I asked the class to vote upon which they would prefer, a fourth of a day picnic out on the lake front or to spend the same time ciphering against some other room. They voted almost as a unit to cipher against the other room. They had been doing the grinding process, it is true, but do you think it had been marking time with them?

One of my boyhood spelling books has marks to show that I had studied the lesson more than sixty times. I wanted to be faithful, I thought I was doing the right thing. But I was not. I should have learned the lesson by heart so that I could have spelled it from beginning to end in less than sixty times study if I had really studied. What a saving of time if my teacher had taught me how to study my spelling, to think each word over slowly and carefully as I spelled it to myself, to center my best efforts on the words in the list which I was not sure of knowing, instead of studying all alike. Then if I had been taught to study I should never have kept careful account as to how many times I studied the lesson. My thought was to satisfy myself and my teacher that I had tried, instead of getting the lesson.

I have known pupils who would, unless restrained, ask for the repetition of half the words in a spelling lesson. Speak distinctly, and teach pupils to listen attentively. It is the part of the pupil's duty to listen attentively to every word of the teacher that is addressed to him or his class. Another habit of many teachers is after a question has been properly answered by some pupil, to again state the answer herself. Nothing is more deadening either to the pupil who first gave the answer or to the interest of the class. If a pupil answers a question accurately, no further comment is necessary.

{"section_text": "\n\t6. The method of choosing sides and spelling for captain.\u2014Two pupils \"choose up.\" These make some guess for first choice of spellers. The one beating in the guess\u2014as for example at what page I have opened this book or similar guess\u2014gets first choice. Then each chooses alternately, dividing the school into two sides. Those who \"choose up\" spell first. As fast as a pupil is \"turned down\" the next choice on that side takes his place. When one side is down it is best to spell through next time beginning with last to be chosen on each side. (2) The one objection to the plan above is that the best spellers do most of the spelling.\u2014This may be overcome by spelling by \"tally.\" The plan is to let the captains who \"choose up,\" as in the first method, stand in opposite corners of the room. Let one stand in the northeast corner of the room while the other stands in the southwest corner. As each pupil is chosen he takes his place on the left of his captain. When the choosing is over the pupils will stand in two opposing bodies on opposite sides of the room. Let all pupils on one side be called \" Number One\" and all on the other side be called \"Number Two.\" Each pupil is to keep this number no matter where or in what position he may be while the spelling is going on. Then two reliable pupils, one from each side, are chosen to keep \"tally.\" You are now ready to begin the spelling. Suppose you begin with the captain on side \"Number One.\" He spells the word correctly and crosses the room and takes his place at the foot of side \"Number Two.\" As he crosses the floor he calls out in distinct tones \"Number One.\" The pupils who are keeping \"tally\" give side \"Number One\" one credit or \"tally\" by placing a straight line in the column headed \"Number One.\" The spelling then continues down side \"Number One.\" If a word is missed the the next below spells it and passes up the same as in the ordinary oral spelling class. When the last in side \"Number One\" has spelled you pronounce the next word to the first or captain of side \"Number Two.\" He spells the word and crosses the room, calling out distinctly as he crosses, \"Number Two,\" and side", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 16, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      Twenty Talks to Teachers    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Thomas E.

It is seldom that they give long continued mental effort to one subject during school hours. In fact, the worst drawback to teaching to one who seeks to be a scholar in the best sense of the term, is that his attention is continually divided. He cannot concentrate his mind on one subject long enough. He must divide his time between government and the teaching process. For this reason, those who wish to be scholars rather than teachers seek to teach in the universities rather than in the primary or secondary schools.\u2013 Here they may specialize. Here their class work is free from government proper. Their students are mature. The mature thought of the student stimulates the teacher and the investigator.

He feels that he is making his city the cleanest, the brightest, the healthiest and the most beautiful in the world. When he turns at the end of his beat to see behind him a street immaculate, there swells in him a worthy pride of his work and his worth, a thrill as pardonable and as justifiable as that in the mayor's breast as he reviews his uniformed police. The teamster with his load of coal, dirty and begrimed though he may be, should forget his toil and drudgery in the conviction that he is helping humanity to keep warm while in turn he is earning an honest living and the comforts of home for himself and family.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 20, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      Twenty Talks to Teachers    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Thomas E.
