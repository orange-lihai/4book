His father, who, as the name implies, was of good family, was accustomed to spend half the year at Rennes when the local parliament, in which he held a commission as councillor, was in session, and the rest of the time on his family estate of Les Cartes at La Haye. Ren\u00e9, the second of a family of two sons and one daughter, was sent at the age of eight years to the Jesuit School at La Fl\u00eache, and of the admirable discipline and education there given he speaks most highly. On account of his delicate health he was permitted to lie in bed till late in the mornings; this was a custom which he always followed, and when he visited Pascal in 1647 he told him that the only way to do good work in mathematics and to preserve his health was never to allow anyone to make him get up in the morning before he felt inclined to do so; an opinion which I chronicle for the benefit of any schoolboy into whose hands this work may fall.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 0, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

Here, through the medium of the Jesuits, he made the acquaintance of Mydorge, and renewed his schoolboy friendship with Mersenne, and together with them he devoted the two years of 1615 and 1616 to the study of mathematics. At that time a man of position usually entered either the army or the church; Descartes chose the former profession, and in 1617 joined the army of Prince Maurice of Orange, then at Breda. Walking through the streets there he saw a placard in Dutch which excited his curiosity, and stopping the first passer, asked him to translate it into either French or Latin. The stranger, who happened to be Isaac Beeckman, the head of the Dutch College at Dort, offered to do so if Descartes would answer it; the placard being, in fact, a challenge to all the world to solve a certain geometrical problem. Descartes worked it out within a few hours, and a warm friendship between him and Beeckman was the result. This unexpected test of his mathematical attainments made the uncongenial life of the army distasteful to him, but under family influence and tradition he remained a soldier, and was persuaded at the commencement of the Thirty Years' War to volunteer under Count de Bucquoy in the army of Bavaria. He continued all this time to occupy his leisure with mathematical studies, and was accustomed to date the first ideas of his new philosophy and of his analytical geometry from three dreams which he experienced on the night of November 10, 1619, at Neuberg, when campaigning on the Danube. He regarded this as the critical day of his life, and one which determined his whole future.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 0, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

The earliest philosophers were Greeks who occupied themselves mainly with the relations between God and Nature, and dealt with Man separately. The Christian Church was so absorbed in the relation of God to Man as entirely to neglect Nature. Finally, modern philosophers concern themselves chiefly with the relations between Man and Nature.

The then current definition of a tangent at a point was a straight line through the point such that between it and the curve no other straight line could be drawn, that is, the straight line of closest contact. Descartes proposed to substitute for this a statement equivalent to the assertion that the tangent is the limiting position of the secant; Fermat, and at a later date Maclaurin and Lagrange, adopted this definition. Barrow, followed by Newton and Leibnitz, considered a curve as the limit of an inscribed polygon when the sides become indefinitely small, and stated that the side of the polygon when produced became in the limit a tangent to the curve. Roberval, on the other hand, defined a tangent at a point as the direction of motion at that instant of a point which was describing the curve. The results are the same whichever definition is selected, but the controversy as to which definition was the correct one was none the less lively. In his letters Descartes illustrated his theory by giving the general rule for drawing tangents and normals to a roulette.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 0, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

He determined the centre and radius of a circle which should cut the curve in two consecutive points there. The tangent to the circle at that point will be the required tangent to the curve. In modern text-books it is usual to express the condition that two of the points in which a straight line (such as y = mx + c) cuts the curve shall coincide with the given point: this enables us to determine m and c, and thus the equation of the tangent there is determined. Descartes, however, did not venture to do this, but selecting a circle as the simplest curve and one to which he knew how to draw a tangent, he so fixed his circle as to make it touch the given curve at the point in question, and thus reduced the problem to drawing a tangent to a circle.

It is doubtful whether or not Descartes recognized that his letters might represent any quantities, positive or negative, and that it was sufficient to prove a proposition for one general case. He was the earliest writer to realise the advantage to be obtained by taking all the terms of an equation to one side of it, though Stifel and Harriot had sometimes employed that form by choice. He realised the meaning of negative quantities and used them freely. In this book he made use of the rule for finding the limit to the number of positive and of negative roots of an algebraical equation, which is still known by his name; and introduced the method of indeterminate coefficients for the solution of equations. He believed that he had given a method by which algebraical equations of any order could be solved, but in this he was mistaken.

{"section_text": "\n\tDescartes's physical theory of the universe, embodying most of the results contained in his earlier and unpublished Le Monde, is given in his Principia, 1644, and rests on a metaphysical basis. He commences with a discussion on motion; and then lays down ten laws of nature, of which the first two are almost identical with the first two laws of motion as given by Newton; the remaining eight laws are inaccurate. He next proceeds to discuss the nature of matter which he regards as uniform in kind though there are three forms of it. He assumes that the matter of the universe must be in motion, and that the motion must result in a number of vortices. He states that the sun is the centre of an immense whirlpool of this matter, in which the planets float and are swept round like straws in a whirlpool of water. Each planet is supposed to be the centre of a secondary whirlpool by which its satellites are carried: these secondary whirlpools are supposed to produce variations of density in the surrounding medium which constitute the primary whirlpool, and so cause the planets to move in ellipses and not in circles. All these assumptions are arbitrary and unsupported by any investigation. It is not difficult to prove that on his hypothesis the sun would be in the centre of these ellipses, and not at a focus (as Kepler had shewn was the case), and that the weight of a body at every place on the surface of the earth except the equator would act in a direction which was not vertical; but it will be sufficient here to say that Newton in the second book of his Principia, 1687, considered the theory in detail, and showed that its consequences are not only inconsistent with each of Kepler's laws and with the fundamental laws of mechanics, but are also at variance with the laws of nature assumed by Descartes. Still, in spite of its crudeness and its inherent defects, the theory of vortices marks a fresh era in astronomy, for it was an attempt to explain the phenomena of the whole universe by the same mechanical laws which experiment shows to be true on the earth.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 0, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

He went to school first at Charterhouse (where he was so troublesome that his father was heard to pray that if it pleased God to take any of his children he could best spare Isaac), and subsequently to Felstead. He completed his education at Trinity College, Cambridge; after taking his degree in 1648, he was elected to a fellowship in 1649; he then resided for a few years in college, but in 1655 he was driven out by the persecution of the Independents. He spent the next four years in the East of Europe, and after many adventures returned to England in 1659. He was ordained the next year, and appointed to the professorship of Greek at Cambridge. In 1662 he was made professor of geometry at Gresham College, and in 1663 was selected as the first occupier of the Lucasian chair at Cambridge. He resigned the latter to his pupil Newton in 1669, whose superior abilities he recognized and frankly acknowledged. For the remainder of his life he devoted himself to the study of divinity.

He, however, joined the moderate Presbyterians in signing the remonstrance against the execution of Charles I., by which he incurred the lasting hostility of the Independents. In spite of their opposition he was appointed in 1649 to the Savilian chair of geometry at Oxford, where he lived until his death on October 28, 1703. Besides his mathematical works he wrote on theology, logic, and philosophy, and was the first to devise a system for teaching deaf-mutes. I confine myself to a few notes on his more important mathematical writings. They are notable partly for the introduction of the use of infinite series as an ordinary part of analysis, and partly for the fact that they revealed and explained to all students the principles of the new methods of analysis introduced by his contemporaries and immediate predecessors.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 2, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

{"section_text": "\n\tAlmost contemporaneously with the publication in 1637 of Descartes' geometry, the principles of the integral calculus, so far as they are concerned with summation, were being worked out in Italy. This was effected by what was called the principle of indivisibles, and was the invention of Cavalieri. It was applied by him and his contemporaries to numerous problems connected with the quadrature of curves and surfaces, the determination on volumes, and the positions of centres of mass. It served the same purpose as the tedious method of exhaustions used by the Greeks; in principle the methods are the same, but the notation of indivisibles is more concise and convenient. It was, in its turn, superceded at the beginning of the eighteenth century by the integral calculus.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 5, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

He was meditating marriage when an accident again turned the current of his thoughts to a religious life. He was driving a four-in-hand on November 23, 1654, when the horses ran away; the two leaders dashed over the parapet of the bridge at Neuilly, and Pascal was saved only by the traces breaking. Always somewhat of a mystic, he considered this a special summons to abandon the world. He wrote an account of the accident on a small piece of parchment, which for the rest of his life he wore next to his heart, to perpetually remind him of his covenant; and shortly moved to Port Royal, where he continued to live until his death in 1662.

Budan, in 1807 and 1811, had enunciated the theorem generally known by the name of Fourier, but the demonstration was not altogether satisfactory.

At last his opportunity came. A plan of a fortress having to be drawn from the data supplied by certain observations, he did it by a geometrical construction. At first the officer in charge refused to receive it, because etiquette required that not less than a certain time should be used in making such drawings, but the superiority of the method over that then taught was so obvious that it was accepted; and in 1768 Monge was made professor, on the understanding that the results of his descriptive geometry were to be a military secret confined to officers above a certain rank.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 10, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

{"section_text": "\n\tJoseph Louis Lagrange, the greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, was born at Turin on January 25, 1736, and died at Paris on April 10, 1813. His father, who had charge of the Sardinian military chest, was of good social position and wealthy, but before his son grew up he had lost most of his property in speculations, and young Lagrange had to rely for his position on his own abilities. He was educated at the college of Turin, but it was not until he was seventeen that he shewed any taste for mathematics - his interest in the subject being first excited by a memoir by Halley across which he came by accident. Alone and unaided he threw himself into mathematical studies; at the end of a year's incessant toil he was already an accomplished mathematician, and was made a lecturer in the artillery school.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 12, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

To effect the solution (in which he sought to determine the form of a function so that a formula in which it entered should satisfy a certain condition) he enunciated the principles of the calculus of variations. Euler recognized the generality of the method adopted, and its superiority to that used by himself; and with rare courtesy he withheld a paper he had previously written, which covered some of the same ground, in order that the young Italian might have time to complete his work, and claim the undisputed invention of the new calculus. The name of this branch of analysis was suggested by Euler.

{"section_text": "\n\tGottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz (or Leibniz) was born at Leipzig on June 21 (O.S.), 1646, and died in Hanover on November 14, 1716. His father died before he was six, and the teaching at the school to which he was then sent was inefficient, but his industry triumphed over all difficulties; by the time he was twelve he had taught himself to read Latin easily, and had begun Greek; and before he was twenty he had mastered the ordinary text-books on mathematics, philosophy, theology and law. Refused the degree of doctor of laws at Leipzig by those who were jealous of his youth and learning, he moved to Nuremberg. An essay which there wrote on the study of law was dedicated to the Elector of Mainz, and led to his appointment by the elector on a commission for the revision of some statutes, from which he was subsequently promoted to the diplomatic service. In the latter capacity he supported (unsuccessfully) the claims of the German candidate for the crown of Poland. The violent seizure of various small places in Alsace in 1670 excited universal alarm in Germany as to the designs of Louis XIV.; and Leibnitz drew up a scheme by which it was proposed to offer German co-operation, if France liked to take Egypt, and use the possessions of that country as a basis for attack against Holland in Asia, provided France would agree to leave Germany undisturbed. This bears a curious resemblance to the similar plan by which Napoleon I. proposed to attack England. In 1672 Leibnitz went to Paris on the invitation of the French government to explain the details of the scheme, but nothing came of it.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 15, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

Most of his philosophical writings were composed in the last twenty or twenty-five years of his life; and the points as to whether his views were original or whether they were appropriated from Spinoza, whom he visited in 1676, is still in question among philosophers, though the evidence seems to point to the originality of Leibnitz. As to Leibnitz's system on philosophy it will be enough to say that he regarded the ultimate elements of the universe as individual percipient beings whom he called monads. According to him the monads are centres of force, and substance is force, while space, matter, and motion are merely phenomenal; finally, the existence of God is inferred from the existing harmony among the monads. His services to literature were almost as considerable as those to philosophy; in particular, I may single out his overthrow of the then prevalent belief that Hebrew was the primeval language of the human race.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 15, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

At that time there was no direct evidence that Leibnitz had seen this manuscript before it was printed in 1704, and accordingly Newton's conjecture was not published; but Gerhardt's discovery of the copy made by Leibnitz tends to confirm the accuracy of Newton's judgement in the matter. It is said by those who question Leibnitz's good faith that to a man of his ability the manuscript, especially if supplemented by the letter of Dec. 10, 1672, would supply sufficient hints to give him a clue as to the methods of the calculus, though as the fluxional notation is not employed in it anyone who used it would have to invent a notation; but this is denied by others.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 15, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

{"section_text": "\n\tThe controversy with Leibnitz was regarded in England as an attempt by foreigners to defraud Newton of the credit of his invention, and the question was complicated on both sides by national jealousies. It was therefore natural, though it was unfortunate, that in England the geometrical and fluxional methods as used by Newton were alone studied and employed. For more than a century the English school was thus out of touch with continental mathematicians. The consequence was that, in spite of the brilliant band of scholars formed by Newton, the improvements in the methods of analysis gradually effected on the continent were almost unknown in Britain. It was not until 1820 that the value of analytical tools was fully recognized in England, and that Newton's countrymen again took any large share in the development of mathematics.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 15, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

{"section_text": "\n\tTo sum the matter up briefly, it seems to me that Leibnitz's work exhibits great skill in analysis, but much of it is unfinished, and when he leaves his symbols and attempts to interpret his results he frequently commits blunders. No doubt the demands of politics, philosophy, and literature on his time may have prevented him from elaborating any problem completely or writing a systematic exposition of his views, though they are no excuse for the mistakes of principle which occur in his papers. Some of his memoirs contain suggestions of methods which have now become valuable means of analysis, such as the use of determinants and of indeterminate co-efficients; but when a writer of manifold interests like Leibnitz throws out innumerable suggestions, some of them are likely to turn out valuable, and to enumerate these (which he did not work out) without reckoning the others (which are wrong) gives a false impression of the value of his work. But in spite of this, his title to fame rests on a sure basis, for by his advocacy of the differential calculus his name is inseparably connected with one of the chief instruments of analysis, as that of Descartes - another philosopher - is similarly connected with analytical geometry.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 15, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

His tastes for scientific research and mathematics were formed at Cambridge, where he resided from 1749 to 1753. He created experimental electricity, and was one of the earliest writers to treat chemistry as an exact science. I mention him here on account of his experiment in 1798 to determine the density of the earth, by estimating its attraction as compared with that of two given lead balls: the result is that the mean density of the earth is about five and a half times that of water.

F. Champollion used so successfully. Young was destined to be a doctor, and after attending lectures at Edinburgh and G\u00f6ttingen entered at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, from which he took his degree in 1799; and to his stay at the University he attributed much of his future distinction. His medical career was not particularly successful, and his favourite maxim that a medical diagnosis is only a balance of probabilities was not appreciated by his patients, who looked for certainty in return for their fee. Fortunately his private means were ample. Several papers contributed to various learned societies from 1798 onwards prove him to have been a mathematician of considerable power; but the researches which have immortalised his name are those by which he laid down the laws of interference of waves and of light, and was thus able to suggest the means by which the chief difficulties then felt in the way of the undulatory theory of light could be overcome.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 17, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

{"section_text": "\n\tTowards the beginning of the last century the more thoughtful members of the Cambridge school of mathematics began to recognize that their isolation from their continental contemporaries was a serious evil. The earliest attempt in England to explain the notation and methods of the calculus as used on the continent was due to Woodhouse, who stands out as the apostle of the new movement. It is doubtful if he could have brought the analytical methods into vogue by himself; but his views were enthusiastically adopted by three students, Peacock, Babbage and Herschel, who succeeded in carrying out the reforms he had suggested. In a book which will fall into the hands of few but English readers I may be pardoned for making space for a few remarks on these four mathematicians, though otherwise a notice of them would not be required in a work of this kind. The original stimulus came from French sources, and I therefore place these remarks at the close of my account of the French school; but I should add that the English mathematicians of this century at one struck out a line independent of their French contemporaries.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 18, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

His theory of colours and his deductions from his optical experiments were at first attacked with considerable vehemence. The correspondence which this entailed on Newton occupied nearly all his leisure in the years 1672 to 1675, and proved extremely distasteful to him. Writing on December 9, 1675, he says, \"I was so persecuted with discussions arising out of my theory of light, that I blamed my own imprudence for parting with so substantial a blessing as my quiet to run after a shadow.\" Again, on November 18, 1676, he observes, \"I see I have made myself a slave to philosophy; but if I get rid of Mr. Linus's business, I will resolutely bid adieu to it eternally, excepting what I do for my private satisfaction, or leave to come out after me; for I see a man must either resolve to put out nothing new, or to become a slave to defend it.\" The unreasonable dislike to have his conclusions doubted or to be involved in any correspondence about them was a prominent trait in Newton's character.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 19, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

The theory is now known to be untenable, but it should be noted that Newton enunciated it as a hypothesis from which certain results would follow: it would seem that he believed that wave theory to be intrinsically more probable, but it was the difficulty of explaining diffraction on that theory that led him to suggest another hypothesis.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 19, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

Newton replied saying that he had abandoned the study of philosophy, but he added that the earth's diurnal motion might be proved by the experiment of observing the deviation from the perpendicular of a stone dropped from a height to the ground \u2014 an experiment which was subsequently made by the Society and succeeded. Hooke in his letter mentioned Picard's geodetical researches; in these Picard used a value of the radius of the earth which is substantially correct. This led Newton to repeat, with Picard's data, his calculations of 1666 on the lunar orbit, and he thus verified his supposition that gravity extended as far as the moon and varied inversely as the square of the distance. He then proceeded to consider the general theory of motion of a particle under a centripetal force, that is, one directed to a fixed point, and showed that the vector would sweep over equal areas in equal times. He also proved that, if a particle describe an ellipse under a centripetal force to a focus, the law must be that of the inverse square of the distance from the focus, and conversely, that the orbit of a particle projected under the influence of such a force would be a conic (or, it may be, he thought only an ellipse). Obeying his rule to publish nothing that could land hum in a scientific controversy these results were locked up in his notebooks, and it was only a specific question addressed to him five years later that led to their publication.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 19, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

Now consider any two consecutive terms in the original equation, and the two symbols written above them. Then we may have any one of the four following cases: (\u03b1) the terms of the same sign and the symbols of the same sign; (\u03b2) the terms of the same sign and the symbols of opposite signs; (\u03b3) the terms of opposite signs and the symbols of the same sign; (\u03b4) the terms of opposite signs and the symbols of opposite signs. Then it has been shewn that the number of negative roots will not exceed the number of cases (\u03b1), and the number of positive roots will not exceed the number of cases (\u03b3); and therefore the number of imaginary roots is not less than the number of cases (\u03b2) and (\u03b4). In other words the number of changes of signs in the row of symbols written above the equation is an inferior limit to the number of imaginary roots. Newton, however, asserted that \"you may almost know how many roots are impossible\" by counting the changes of sign in the series of symbols formed as above. That is to say, he thought that in general the actual number of positive, negative and imaginary roots could be got by the rule and not merely superior or inferior limits to these numbers. But though he knew that the rule was not universal he could not find (or at any rate did not state) what were the exceptions to it: this problem was subsequently discussed by Campbell, Maclaurin, Euler, and other writers; at last in 1865 Sylvester succeeded in proving the general result.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 19, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

{"section_text": "\n\tThe idea of a fluxion or differential coefficient, as treated at this time, is simple. When two quantities \u2014 e.g. the radius of a sphere and its volume \u2014 are so related that a change in one causes a change in the other, the one is said to be a function of the other. The ratio of the rates at which they change is termed the differential coefficient or fluxion of the one with regard to the other, and the process by which this ratio is determined is known as differentiation. Knowing the differential coefficient and one set of corresponding values of the two quantities, it is possible by summation to determine the relation between them, as Cavalieri and others had shewn; but often the process is difficult, if, however, we can reverse the process of differentiation we can obtain this result directly. This process of reversal is termed integration. It was at once seen that problems connected with the quadrature of curves, and the determination of volumes (which were soluble by summation, as had been shewn by the employment of indivisibles), were reducible to integration. In mechanics also, by integration, velocities could be deduced from known accelerations, and distances traversed from known velocities. In short, wherever things change according to known laws, here was a possible method of finding the relation between them. It is true that, when we try to express observed phenomena in the language of the calculus, we usually obtain an equation involving the variables, and their differential coefficients \u2014 and possibly the solution may be beyond our powers. Even so, the method is often fruitful, and its use marked a real advance in thought and power.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 19, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

{"section_text": "\n\tIn character he was religious and conscientious, with an exceptionally high standard of morality, having, as Bishop Burnet said, \"the whitest soul\" he ever knew. Newton was always perfectly straightforward and honest; but in his controversies with Leibnitz, Hooke and others, though scrupulously just, he was not generous; and it would seem that he frequently took offence at a chance expression when none was intended. He modestly attributed his discoveries largely to the admirable work done by his predecessors; and once explained that, if he had seen further than other men, it was only because he had stood on the shoulders of giants. He summed up his own estimate of his work in the sentence, \"I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy, playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself, in now and then finding a smoother pebble, or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\" He was morbidly sensitive to being involved in any discussions. I believe that, with the exception of his papers on optics, every one of his works was published only under pressure from his friends and against his own wishes. There are several instances of his communicating papers and results on condition that his name should not be published: thus when in 1669 he had, at Collins's request, solved some problems on harmonic series and on annuities which had previously baffled investigation, he only gave permission that his results should be published \"so it be,\" as he says, \"without my name to it; for I see not what there is desirable in public esteem, were I able to acquire and maintain it: it would perhaps increase my acquaintance, the things which I chiefly study to decline.\"", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 19, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

In algebra and the theory of equations he introduced the system of literal indices, established the binomial theorem, and created no inconsiderable part of the theory of equations: one rule which he enunciated in this subject remained till a few years ago an unsolved riddle which had overtaxed the resources of succeeding mathematicians. In analytical geometry, he introduced the modern classification of curves into algebraical and transcendental; and established many of the fundamental properties of asymptotes, multiple points, and isolated loops, illustrated by a discussion of cubic curves. The fluxional or infinitesimal calculus was invented by Newton in or before the year 1666, and circulated in manuscript amongst his friends in and after the year 1669, though no account of the method was printed till 1693. The fact that the results are nowadays expressed in a different notation has led to Newton's investigations on this subject being somewhat overlooked.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 19, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.

His magnetic observations mostly took place from 1823 to 1826. He discovered what has been called rotatory magnetism, and the fact that most bodies could be magnetized; these discoveries were completed and explained by Faraday. He warmly supported Fresnel's optical theories, and the two philosophers conducted together those experiments on the polarization of light which led to the inference that the vibrations of the luminiferous ether were transverse to the direction of motion, and that polarization consisted in a resolution of rectilinear motion into components at right angles to each other. The subsequent invention of the polariscope and discover of rotatory polarization are due to Arago. The general idea of the experimental determination of the velocity of light in the manner subsequently effected by Fizeau and Foucault was suggested by him in 1838, but his failing eyesight prevented his arranging the details or making the experiments.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 20, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      A Short Account of the History of Mathematics    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "W.W.
