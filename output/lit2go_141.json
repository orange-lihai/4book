{"section_text": "\n\tThere once lived a poor tailor, who had a son called Aladdin, a careless, idle boy who would do nothing but play ball all day long in the streets with little idle boys like himself. This so grieved the father that he died; yet, in spite of his mother\u2019s tears and prayers, Aladdin did not mend his ways. One day, when he was playing in the streets as usual, a stranger asked him his age, and if he was not the son of Mustapha the tailor. \u201cI am, sir,\u201d replied Aladdin; \u201cbut he died a long while ago.\u201d On this the stranger, who was a famous African magician, fell on his neck and kissed him, saying, \u201cI am your uncle, and knew you from your likeness to my brother. Go to your mother and tell her I am coming.\u201d Aladdin ran home and told his mother of his newly found uncle. \u201cIndeed, child,\u201d she said, \u201cyour father had a brother, but I always thought he was dead.\u201d However, she prepared supper, and bade Aladdin seek his uncle, who came laden with wine and fruit. He presently fell down and kissed the place where Mustapha used to sit, bidding Aladdin\u2019s mother not to be surprised at not having seen him before, as he had been forty years out of the country. He then turned to Aladdin, and asked him his trade, at which the boy hung his head, while his mother burst into tears. On learning that Aladdin was idle and would learn no trade, he offered to take a shop for him and stock it with merchandise. Next day he bought Aladdin a fine suit of clothes and took him all over the city, showing him the sights, and brought him home at nightfall to his mother, who was overjoyed to see her son so fine.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 0, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      The Blue Fairy Book    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Andrew Lang", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/141.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        23,286      ", "iid": "141", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//141/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Lang, A.

They sat down by a fountain and the magician pulled a cake from his girdle, which he divided between them. They then journeyed onward till they almost reached the mountains.

The earth trembled a little and opened in front of them, disclosing a square flat stone with a brass ring in the middle to raise it by. Aladdin tried to run away, but the magician caught him and gave him a blow that knocked him down. \u201cWhat have I done, uncle?\u201d he said piteously; whereupon the magician said more kindly: \u201cFear nothing, but obey me. Beneath this stone lies a treasure which is to be yours, and no one else may touch it, so you must do exactly as I tell you.\u201d At the word treasure Aladdin forgot his fears, and grasped the ring as he was told, saying the names of his father and grandfather.

At last he clasped his hands in prayer, and in so doing rubbed the ring, which the magician had forgotten to take from him. Immediately an enormous and frightful genie rose out of the earth, saying: \u201cWhat wouldst thou with me? I am the Slave of the Ring, and will obey thee in all things.\u201d Aladdin fearlessly replied: \u201cDeliver me from this place!\u201d whereupon the earth opened, and he found himself outside.

He then asked for some food. \u201cAlas! child,\u201d she said, \u201cI have nothing in the house, but I have spun a little cotton and will go and sell it.\u201d Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the lamp instead. As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it might fetch a higher price. Instantly a hideous genie appeared, and asked what she would have. She fainted away, but Aladdin, snatching the lamp, said boldly: \u201cFetch me something to eat!\u201d The genie returned with a silver bowl, twelve silver plates containing rich meats, two silver cups, and two bottles of wine. Aladdin\u2019s mother, when she came to herself, said: \u201cWhence comes this splendid feast?\u201d \u201cAsk not, but eat,\u201d replied Aladdin. So they sat at breakfast till it was dinner-time, and Aladdin told his mother about the lamp. She begged him to sell it, and have nothing to do with devils. \u201cNo,\u201d said Aladdin, \u201csince chance hath made us aware of its virtues, we will use it, and the ring likewise, which I shall always wear on my finger.\u201d When they had eaten all the genie had brought, Aladdin sold one of the silver plates, and so on until none were left.

Aladdin was seized by a desire to see her face, which was very difficult, as she always went veiled. He hid himself behind the door of the bath, and peeped through a chink. The Princess lifted her veil as she went in, and looked so beautiful that Aladdin fell in love with her at first sight. He went home so changed that his mother was frightened. He told her he loved the Princess so deeply that he could not live without her, and meant to ask her in marriage of her father. His mother, on hearing this, burst out laughing, but Aladdin at last prevailed upon her to go before the Sultan and carry his request. She fetched a napkin and laid in it the magic fruits from the enchanted garden, which sparkled and shone like the most beautiful jewels. She took these with her to please the Sultan, and set out, trusting in the lamp. The Grand Vizier and the lords of council had just gone in as she entered the hall and placed herself in front of the Sultan. He, however, took no notice of her. She went every day for a week, and stood in the same place. When the council broke up on the sixth day the Sultan said to his Vizier: \u201cI see a certain woman in the audience-chamber every day carrying something in a napkin. Call her next time, that I may find out what she wants.\u201d Next day, at a sign from the Vizier, she went up to the foot of the throne and remained kneeling till the Sultan said to her: \u201cRise, good woman, and tell me what you want.\u201d She hesitated, so the Sultan sent away all but the Vizier, and bade her speak frankly, promising to forgive her beforehand for anything she might say. She then told him of her son\u2019s violent love for the Princess. \u201cI prayed him to forget her,\u201d she said, \u201cbut in vain; he threatened to do some desperate deed if I refused to go and ask your Majesty for the hand of the Princess. Now I pray you to forgive not me alone, but my son Aladdin.\u201d The Sultan asked her kindly what she had in the napkin, whereupon she unfolded the jewels and presented them. He was thunderstruck, and turning to the Vizier said: \u201cWhat sayest thou? Ought I not to bestow the Princess on one who values her at such a price?\u201d The Vizier, who wanted her for his own son, begged the Sultan to withhold her for three months, in the course of which he hoped his son would contrive to make him a richer present.

{"section_text": "\n\tWhen the three months were over, Aladdin sent his mother to remind the Sultan of his promise. She stood in the same place as before, and the Sultan, who had forgotten Aladdin, at once remembered him, and sent for her. On seeing her poverty the Sultan felt less inclined than ever to keep his word, and asked his Vizier\u2019s advice, who counselled him to set so high a value on the Princess that no man living could come up to it. The Sultan then turned to Aladdin\u2019s mother, saying: \u201cGood woman, a Sultan must remember his promises, and I will remember mine, but your son must first send me forty basins of gold brimful of jewels, carried by forty black slaves, led by as many white ones, splendidly dressed. Tell him that I await his answer.\u201d The mother of Aladdin bowed low and went home, thinking all was lost. She gave Aladdin the message, adding: \u201cHe may wait long enough for your answer!\u201d \u201cNot so long, mother, as you think,\u201d her son replied. \u201cI would do a great deal more than that for the Princess.\u201d He summoned the genie, and in a few moments the eighty slaves arrived, and filled up the small house and garden. Aladdin made them set out to the palace, two and two, followed by his mother. They were so richly dressed, with such splendid jewels in their girdles, that everyone crowded to see them and the basins of gold they carried on their heads. They entered the palace, and, after kneeling before the Sultan, stood in a half-circle round the throne with their arms crossed, while Aladdin\u2019s mother presented them to the Sultan. He hesitated no longer, but said: \u201cGood woman, return and tell your son that I wait for him with open arms.\u201d She lost no time in telling Aladdin, bidding him make haste. But Aladdin first called the genie. \u201cI want a scented bath,\u201d he said, \u201ca richly embroidered habit, a horse surpassing the Sultan\u2019s, and twenty slaves to attend me. Besides this, six slaves, beautifully dressed, to wait on my mother; and lastly, ten thousand pieces of gold in ten purses.\u201d No sooner said than done. Aladdin mounted his horse and passed through the streets, the slaves strewing gold as they went. Those who had played with him in his childhood knew him not, he had grown so handsome. When the Sultan saw him he came down from his throne, embraced him, and led him into a hall where a feast was spread, intending to marry him to the Princess that very day. But Aladdin refused, saying, \u201cI must build a palace fit for her,\u201d and took his leave. Once home, he said to the genie: \u201cBuild me a palace of the finest marble, set with jasper, agate, and other precious stones. In the middle you shall build me a large hall with a dome, its four walls of massy gold and silver, each having six windows, whose lattices, all except one which is to be left unfinished, must be set with diamonds and rubies.

The Sultan sent musicians with trumpets and cymbals to meet them, so that the air resounded with music and cheers. She was taken to the Princess, who saluted her and treated her with great honor. At night the Princess said good-by to her father, and set out on the carpet for Aladdin\u2019s palace, with his mother at her side, and followed by the hundred slaves. She was charmed at the sight of Aladdin, who ran to receive her. \u201cPrincess,\u201d he said, \u201cblame your beauty for my boldness if I have displeased you.\u201d She told him that, having seen him, she willingly obeyed her father in this matter. After the wedding had taken place Aladdin led her into the hall, where a feast was spread, and she supped with him, after which they danced till midnight. Next day Aladdin invited the Sultan to see the palace. On entering the hall with the four-and-twenty windows, with their rubies, diamonds, and emeralds, he cried: \u201cIt is a world\u2019s wonder! There is only one thing that surprises me. Was it by accident that one window was left unfinished?\u201d \u201cNo, sir, by design,\u201d returned Aladdin. \u201cI wished your Majesty to have the glory of finishing this palace.\u201d The Sultan was pleased, and sent for the best jewelers in the city. He showed them the unfinished window, and bade them fit it up like the others. \u201cSir,\u201d replied their spokesman, \u201cwe cannot find jewels enough.\u201d The Sultan had his own fetched, which they soon used, but to no purpose, for in a month\u2019s time the work was not half done. Aladdin, knowing that their task was vain, bade them undo their work and carry the jewels back, and the genie finished the window at his command. The Sultan was surprised to receive his jewels again, and visited Aladdin, who showed him the window finished.

{"section_text": "\n\tNext morning the Sultan looked out of the window toward Aladdin\u2019s palace and rubbed his eyes, for it was gone. He sent for the Vizier and asked what had become of the palace. The Vizier looked out too, and was lost in astonishment. He again put it down to enchantment, and this time the Sultan believed him, and sent thirty men on horseback to fetch Aladdin in chains. They met him riding home, bound him, and forced him to go with them on foot. The people, however, who loved him, followed, armed, to see that he came to no harm. He was carried before the Sultan, who ordered the executioner to cut off his head. The executioner made Aladdin kneel down, bandaged his eyes, and raised his scimitar to strike. At that instant the Vizier, who saw that the crowd had forced their way into the courtyard and were scaling the walls to rescue Aladdin, called to the executioner to stay his hand. The people, indeed, looked so threatening that the Sultan gave way and ordered Aladdin to be unbound, and pardoned him in the sight of the crowd. Aladdin now begged to know what he had done. \u201cFalse wretch!\u201d said the Sultan, \u201ccome thither,\u201d and showed him from the window the place where his palace had stood. Aladdin was so amazed that he could not say a word. \u201cWhere is my palace and my daughter?\u201d demanded the Sultan. \u201cFor the first I am not so deeply concerned, but my daughter I must have, and you must find her or lose your head.\u201d Aladdin begged for forty days in which to find her, promising, if he failed, to return and suffer death at the Sultan\u2019s pleasure. His prayer was granted, and he went forth sadly from the Sultan\u2019s presence.

{"section_text": "\n\tThat morning the Princess rose earlier than she had done since she had been carried into Africa by the magician, whose company she was forced to endure once a day. She, however, treated him so harshly that he dared not live there altogether. As she was dressing, one of her women looked out and saw Aladdin. The Princess ran and opened the window, and at the noise she made Aladdin looked up. She called to him to come to her, and great was the joy of these lovers at seeing each other again. After he had kissed her Aladdin said: \u201cI beg of you, Princess, in God\u2019s name, before we speak of anything else, for your own sake and mine, tell me what has become of an old lamp I left on the cornice in the hall of four-and-twenty windows, when I went a-hunting.\u201d \u201cAlas!\u201d she said, \u201cI am the innocent cause of our sorrows,\u201d and told him of the exchange of the lamp. \u201cNow I know,\u201d cried Aladdin, \u201cthat we have to thank the African magician for this! Where is the lamp?\u201d \u201cHe carries it about with him,\u201d said the Princess. \u201cI know, for he pulled it out of his breast to show me. He wishes me to break my faith with you and marry him, saying that you were beheaded by my father\u2019s command. He is for ever speaking ill of you but I only reply by my tears. If I persist, I doubt not but he will use violence.\u201d Aladdin comforted her, and left her for a while. He changed clothes with the first person he met in the town, and having bought a certain powder, returned to the Princess, who let him in by a little side door. \u201cPut on your most beautiful dress,\u201d he said to her \u201cand receive the magician with smiles, leading him to believe that you have forgotten me. Invite him to sup with you, and say you wish to taste the wine of his country. He will go for some and while he is gone I will tell you what to do.\u201d She listened carefully to Aladdin and when he left she arrayed herself gaily for the first time since she left China. She put on a girdle and head-dress of diamonds, and, seeing in a glass that she was more beautiful than ever, received the magician, saying, to his great amazement: \u201cI have made up my mind that Aladdin is dead, and that all my tears will not bring him back to me, so I am resolved to mourn no more, and have therefore invited you to sup with me; but I am tired of the wines of China, and would fain taste those of Africa.\u201d The magician flew to his cellar, and the Princess put the powder Aladdin had given her in her cup. When he returned she asked him to drink her health in the wine of Africa, handing him her cup in exchange for his, as a sign she was reconciled to him. Before drinking the magician made her a speech in praise of her beauty, but the Princess cut him short, saying: \u201cLet us drink first, and you shall say what you will afterward.\u201d She set her cup to her lips and kept it there, while the magician drained his to the dregs and fell back lifeless. The Princess then opened the door to Aladdin, and flung her arms round his neck; but Aladdin put her away, bidding her leave him, as he had more to do. He then went to the dead magician, took the lamp out of his vest, and bade the genie carry the palace and all in it back to China.

{"section_text": "\n\tThe African magician had a younger brother, who was, if possible, more wicked and more cunning than himself. He traveled to China to avenge his brother\u2019s death, and went to visit a pious woman called Fatima, thinking she might be of use to him. He entered her cell and clapped a dagger to her breast, telling her to rise and do his bidding on pain of death. He changed clothes with her, colored his face like hers, put on her veil, and murdered her, that she might tell no tales. Then he went toward the palace of Aladdin, and all the people, thinking he was the holy woman, gathered round him, kissing his hands and begging his blessing. When he got to the palace there was such a noise going on round him that the Princess bade her slave look out of the window and ask what was the matter. The slave said it was the holy woman, curing people by her touch of their ailments, whereupon the Princess, who had long desired to see Fatima, sent for her. On coming to the Princess the magician offered up a prayer for her health and prosperity. When he had done the Princess made him sit by her, and begged him to stay with her always. The false Fatima, who wished for nothing better, consented, but kept his veil down for fear of discovery. The Princess showed him the hall, and asked him what he thought of it. \u201cIt is truly beautiful,\u201d said the false Fatima. \u201cIn my mind it wants but one thing.\u201d \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d said the Princess. \u201cIf only a roc\u2019s egg,\u201d replied he, \u201cwere hung up from the middle of this dome, it would be the wonder of the world.\u201d", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 0, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      The Blue Fairy Book    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Andrew Lang", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/141.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        23,286      ", "iid": "141", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//141/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Lang, A.
