The father of these four \u2018idle mouths\u2019, had done (let us say) five thousand pounds\u2019 worth of useful work for the community. In return for this, the community had given him what amounted to a written promise to hand over, whenever called upon to do so, five thousand pounds\u2019 worth of food, etc. Then, if he only uses one thousand pounds\u2019 worth himself, and leaves the rest of the notes to his children, surely they have a full right to present these written promises, and to say \u2018hand over the food, for which the equivalent labour has been already done\u2019.
