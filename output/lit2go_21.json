I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about some- body that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog cry- ing about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn\u2019t make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me.

Afterwards Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance, and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he wouldn\u2019t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, \u201cHm! What you know \u2018bout witches?\u201d and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that five- center piece; but they wouldn\u2019t touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it.

Why can\u2019t Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to my self, there ain\u2019t nothing in it. I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was \u201cspiritual gifts.\u201d This was too many for me, but she told me what she meant \u2013 I must help other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn\u2019t see no advantage about it \u2013 except for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn\u2019t worry about it any more, but just let it go.

{"section_text": "\n We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. All the boys did. We hadn\u2019t robbed nobody, hadn\u2019t killed any people, but only just pretended. We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them. Tom Sawyer called the hogs \u201cingots,\u201d and he called the turnips and stuff \u201cjulery,\u201d and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and marked. But I couldn\u2019t see no profit in it. One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand \u201csumter\u201d mules, all loaded down with di\u2019monds, and they didn\u2019t have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things. He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready. He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn\u2019t worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before. I didn\u2019t believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill. But there warn\u2019t no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn\u2019t no camels nor no elephants. It warn\u2019t anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at that. We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut. I didn\u2019t see no di\u2019monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. I said, why couldn\u2019t we see them, then? He said if I warn\u2019t so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking. He said it was all done by enchantment. He said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant Sundayschool, just out of spite. I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians.

I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn\u2019t no good because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it wouldn\u2019t pass nohow, even if the brass didn\u2019t show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every time. (I reckoned I wouldn\u2019t say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball would take it, because maybe it wouldn\u2019t know the difference. Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball would think it was good. He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next morning you couldn\u2019t see no brass, and it wouldn\u2019t feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball.

And don\u2019t go about women in that old calico. You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe.

They was different from any pictures I ever see before \u2013 blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said \u201cShall I Never See Thee More Alas.\u201d Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said \u201cI Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.\u201d There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said \u201cAnd Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.\u201d These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn\u2019t somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard. She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon \u2013 and the idea was to see which pair would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 17, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Mark Twain", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/21.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        124,983      ", "iid": "21", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//21/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Twain, M.

He was well born, as the saying is, and that\u2019s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn\u2019t no more quality than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn\u2019t no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn\u2019t ever loud. He was as kind as he could be \u2013 you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards. He didn\u2019t ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners \u2013 everybody was always goodmannered where he was. Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always \u2013 I mean he made it seem like good weather.

It was a monstrous big river down there \u2013 sometimes a mile and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up \u2013 nearly always in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and willows, and hid the raft with them. Then we set out the lines. Next we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound anywheres \u2013 perfectly still \u2013 just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe.

And afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by lazy off to sleep. Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the other side you couldn\u2019t tell nothing about her only whether she was a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn\u2019t be nothing to hear nor nothing to see \u2013 just solid lonesomeness. Next you\u2019d see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it chopping, because they\u2019re most always doing it on a raft; you\u2019d see the axe flash and come down \u2013 you don\u2019t hear nothing; you see that axe go up again, and by the time it\u2019s above the man\u2019s head then you hear the K\u2019CHUNK! \u2013 it had took all that time to come over the water. So we would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.

Why, I couldn\u2019t a thought of them in a year. And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring \u2013 said he wanted to ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn\u2019t listen, and the whole show come to a standstill. Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, \u201cKnock him down! throw him out!\u201d and one or two women begun to scream. So, then, the ringmaster he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn\u2019t be no disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn\u2019t make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse. So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down. And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t\u2019other one on t\u2019other side, and the people just crazy. It warn\u2019t funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire too. He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn\u2019t ever drunk in his life \u2013 and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them. He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum \u2013 and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 22, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Mark Twain", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/21.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        124,983      ", "iid": "21", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//21/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Twain, M.

And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain. My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom. He WAS a blossom. He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning. And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs. \u2018Fetch up Nell Gwynn,\u2019 he says. They fetch her up. Next morning, \u2018Chop off her head!\u2019 And they chop it off. \u2018Fetch up Jane Shore,\u2019 he says; and up she comes, Next morning, \u2018Chop off her head\u2019 \u2013 and they chop it off. \u2018Ring up Fair Rosamun.\u2019 Fair Rosamun answers the bell. Next morning, \u2018Chop off her head.\u2019 And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book \u2013 which was a good name and stated the case. You don\u2019t know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I\u2019ve struck in history. Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How does he go at it \u2013 give notice? \u2013 give the country a show? No. All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. That was HIS style \u2013 he never give anybody a chance. He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do? Ask him to show up? No \u2013 drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. S\u2019pose people left money laying around where he was \u2013 what did he do? He collared it. S\u2019pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn\u2019t set down there and see that he done it \u2013 what did he do? He always done the other thing. S\u2019pose he opened his mouth \u2013 what then? If he didn\u2019t shut it up powerful quick he\u2019d lose a lie every time. That\u2019s the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we\u2019d a had him along \u2018stead of our kings he\u2019d a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done. I don\u2019t say that ourn is lambs, because they ain\u2019t, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain\u2019t nothing to THAT old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. Take them all around, they\u2019re a mighty ornery lot.

That\u2019s just the way: a person does a low-down thing, and then he don\u2019t want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he can hide, it ain\u2019t no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The more I studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven,whilst I was stealing a poor old woman\u2019s nigger that hadn\u2019t ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there\u2019s One that\u2019s always on the lookout, and ain\u2019t agoing to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared.

He said if we warn\u2019t prisoners it would be a very different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he warn\u2019t a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we NEEDED. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn\u2019t need it to get out of prison with; there\u2019s where the difference was. He said if I\u2019d a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right.
