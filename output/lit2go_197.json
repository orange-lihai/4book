Euler made it apparent in his Thoughts on the Elements of Bodies, that the smallest particles could possibly be as small as anything that we could imagine by being either infinitely small or nothing at all. That the elements of matter for which the force of inertia is a general property as is space and impenetrability, cannot be endowed with the power of continuous change anymore that Epicurious\u2019s atoms, and therefore all of the conclusions concerning the diversity of these forces taken from the principle of indiscernibilty collapse into themselves.
