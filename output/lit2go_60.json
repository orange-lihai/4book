At these times they were uncanny and sinister in their unblinking scrutiny, and the men hooted angrily at them, telling them to be gone. One came, and evidently decided to alight on the top of the captain\u2019s head. The bird flew parallel to the boat and did not circle, but made short sidelong jumps in the air in chicken-fashion.
