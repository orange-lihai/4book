The fowls were poor from not having the proper food, and coral sand did not answer as a substitute for gravel.

{"section_text": "\n\tMany of our people now came down with a sort of intermittent or \u201cbreakbone\u201d fever; rightly named, for my own sensations were that the bones were being crushed, and the pain was veritable agony. It went through the families and among the men and soldiers. The list of the well, my husband said, was easier given than those who were on the sick report. His duties were now extremely arduous. Besides being post surgeon he was health officer, and was rowed long distances in his six-oared barge under a torrid sun to visit every vessel that approached. All felt that their safety was in his hands and that his careful watch and strict enforcement of the quarantine would result in our exemption from the scourge. He was obeyed implicitly, and for a time we escaped the fever, but the \u201cbreak-bone\u201d singled us out one by one, and several times alarming symptoms of the dreaded yellow fever appeared. My husband was very ill, but he never gave up, and said, laughingly, \u201cthat he could not afford to be sick with so many in the hospitals.\u201d The doctor who had been sent down from Key West to take Dr. Hoffman\u2019s place was evidently too ill with consumption to ever do duty, so Colonel Tinelle sent for another surgeon from Hilton Head; but some time elapsed before one came, and if my husband had succumbed meanwhile I do not know what we should have done. The war news that reached us now was most depressing, and had its effect on both officers and men, especially as it might be weeks before we could learn the result: \u201cThirty thousand confederate troops within eight miles of Washington and within eight miles of Cincinnati.\u201d This created intense excitement, and finally one day we had to acknowledge that the yellow fever had come; how we knew not; only the \u201cbreak-bone\u201d fever, seemingly its fist cousin, grew worse and worse, until finally it merged into genuine yellow fever. There were five deaths only, in these sad days that oppressed us like a nightmare; then, mercifully a norther came the spectre disappeared.
