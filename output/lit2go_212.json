This proof was given, in the earlier editions, incidentally, in the course of the discus- sion of the Biliteral Diagram: but its proper place, in this treatise, is where I have now introduced it. I n the Sorites-Examples, I have made a good many verbal alterations, in order to evade a difficulty, which I fear will have perplexed some of the Readers of the first three Editions. Some of the Premisses were so worded that their Terms were not Specieses of the Univ. named in the Dictionary, but of a larger Class, of which the Univ. was only a portion. In all such cases, it was intended that the Reader should perceive that what was asserted of the larger Class was thereby asserted of the Univ., and should ignore, as superfluous, all that it asserted of it other portion. Thus, in Ex. 15, the Univ. was stated to be \u201cducks in this village,\u201d and the third Premiss was \u201cMrs. Bond has no gray ducks,\u201d i.e. \u201cNo gray ducks are ducks belonging to Mrs. Bond.\u201d Here the Terms are not Specieses of the Univ., but of the larger Class \u201cducks,\u201d of which the Univ. is only a portion: and it was intended that the Reader should perceive that what is here asserted of \u201cducks\u201d is thereby asserted of \u201cducks in this village.\u201d and should treat this Premiss as if it were \u201cMrs. Bond has no gray ducks in this village,\u201d and should ignore, as superfluous, what it asserts as to the other portion of the Class \u201cducks,\u201d viz. \u201cMrs. Bond has no gray ducks out of this village\u201d.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 2, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      Symbollic Logic    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Lewis Carroll", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/212.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        47,953      ", "iid": "212", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//212/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Carroll, L.
