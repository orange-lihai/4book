{"section_text": "\n\tIn acknowledging my obligations to previous writers I must begin with Archbishop Whately, whose writings first gave me an interest in the subject. The works of Mill and Hamilton have of course been freely drawn upon. I have not followed either of those two great writers exclusively, but have endeavoured to assimilate what seemed best in both. To Professor Fowler I am under a special debt. I had not the privilege of personal teaching from him in logic,\u2014as I had in some other subjects; but his book fell into my hands at an early period in my mental training, and was so thoroughly studied as to have become a permanent part of the furniture of my mind. Much the same may be said of my relation to the late Professor Jevons\u2019s Elementary Lessons in Logic. Two other books, which I feel bound to mention with special emphasis, are Hansel\u2019s edition of Aldrich and McCosh\u2019s Laws of Discursive Thought. If there be added to the foregoing Watts\u2019s Logic, Thomson\u2019s Outlines of the Laws of Thought, Bain\u2019s Deductive Logic, Jevons\u2019s Studies in Deductive Logic and Principles of Science, Bradley\u2019s Principles of Logic, Abbott\u2019s Elements of Logic, Walker\u2019s edition of Murray, Ray\u2019s Text-book of Deductive Logic, and Weatherley\u2019s Rudiments of Logic, I think the list will be exhausted of modern works from which I am conscious of having borrowed.

Universals therefore do exist in nature, and not merely in the mind of man: but their existence is dependent upon individual objects, instead of individual objects depending for their existence upon them. Aristotle saw this very clearly, and marked the distinction between the objects corresponding to the singular and to the common term by calling the former Primary and the latter Secondary Existences.

We may notice, too, that the relative pronoun, unlike the rest, is necessarily syncategorematic, for the same reason as the subjunctive mood. Of the remaining parts of speech the article, adverb, preposition, and conjunction can never be anything but syncategorematic, while the interjection is acategorematic, like the vocative case of nouns and the imperative and optative moods of verbs, which do not enter at all into the form of sentence known as the proposition.].", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 2, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      Deductive Logic    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "George William Joseph Stock, M.A.", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/189.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        83,149      ", "iid": "189", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//189/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Stock, G.

Substances, so far as we can know them, are only collections of attributes.

The colour, smoothness or solidity of a table cannot be conceived apart from the extension, whereas the whole cluster of attributes which constitutes the table can be conceived to exist altogether independently of other \u2018such clusters.

Since things are divided exhaustively into substances and attributes, it follows that any term which is not the name of a thing capable of being conceived to exist by itself, must be an abstract term. Individual substances can alone be conceived to exist by themselves: all their qualities, actions, passions, and inter-relations, all their states, and all events with regard to them, presuppose the existence of these individual substances. All names therefore of such things as those just enumerated are abstract terms. The term \u2018action,\u2019 for instance, is an abstract term. For how could there be action without an agent? The term \u2018act\u2019 also is equally abstract for the same reason. The difference between \u2018action\u2019 and \u2018act\u2019 is not the difference between abstract and concrete, but the difference between the name of a process and the name of the corresponding product.

The term \u2018virtue,\u2019 for instance, in one sense, namely, as signifying moral excellence in general, without distinction of kind, is strictly a singular term, as being the name of one attribute: but as applied to different varieties of moral excellence\u2014justice, generosity, gentleness and so on\u2014it is a common term, as being a name which is applicable, in the same sense, to a class of attributes. Similarly the term \u2018colour,\u2019 in a certain sense, signifies one unvarying attribute possessed by bodies, namely, the power of affecting the eye, and in this sense it is a singular term: but as applied to the various ways in which the eye may be affected, it is evidently a common term, being equally applicable to red, blue, green, and every other colour. As soon as we begin to abstract from attributes, the higher notion becomes a common term in reference to the lower.

{"section_text": "\n\t162. Hitherto we have been speaking only of christening-names, but it is evident that family names have a certain amount of connotation from the first. For when we dub John with the additional appellation of Smith, we do not give this second name as a mere individual mark, but intend thereby to indicate a relationship to other persons. The amount of connotation that can be conveyed by proper names is very noticeable in the Latin language. Let us take for an example the full name of a distinguished Roman\u2014Publius Cornelius Scipio AEmilianus Africanus minor. Here it is only the praenomen, Publius, that can be said to be a mere individual mark, and even this distinctly indicates the sex of the owner. The nomen proper, Cornelius, declares the wearer of it to belong to the illustrious gens Cornelia. The cognomen, Scipio, further specifies him as a member of a distinguished family in that gens. The agnomen adoptivum indicates his transference by adoption from one gens to another. The second agnomen recalls the fact of his victory over the Carthaginians, while the addition of the word \u2018minor\u2019 distinguishes him from the former wearer of the same title. The name, instead of being devoid of meaning, is a chapter of history in itself. Homeric epithets, such as \u2018The Cloud-compeller,\u2019 \u2018The Earth-shaker\u2019 are instances of intensive proper names. Many of our own family names are obviously connotative in their origin, implying either some personal peculiarity, e.g. Armstrong, Cruikshank, Courteney; or the employment, trade or calling of the original bearer of the name, Smith, Carpenter, Baker, Clark, Leach, Archer, and so on; or else his abode, domain or nationality, as De Caen, De Montmorency, French, Langley; or simply the fact of descent from some presumably more noteworthy parent, as Jackson, Thomson, Fitzgerald, O\u2019Connor, Macdonald, Apjohn, Price, Davids, etc. The question, however, whether a term is connotative or not, has to be decided, not by its origin, but by its use.

Indeed in affirmative propositions the mere juxtaposition of the subject and predicate is often sufficient to indicate their agreement, e.g. \u2018Most haste, worst speed,\u2019 chalepha tha kala.

{"section_text": "\n\t254. The terminology of the division of propositions according to quantity is unsatisfactory. Not only has the indefinite proposition to be set down as particular, even when the sense manifestly declares it to be universal; but the proposition which is expressed in a particular form has also to be construed as indefinite, so that an unnatural meaning is imparted to the word \u2018some,\u2019 as used in logic. If in common conversation we were to say \u2018Some cows chew the cud,\u2019 the person whom we were addressing would doubtless imagine us to suppose that there were some cows which did not possess this attribute. But in logic the word \u2018some\u2019 is not held to express more than \u2018some at least, if not all.\u2019 Hence we find not only that an indefinite proposition may, as a matter of fact, be strictly particular, but that a proposition which appears to be strictly particular may be indefinite. So a proposition expressed in precisely the same form \u2018Some A is B\u2019 may be either strictly particular, if some be taken to exclude all, or indefinite, if the word \u2018some\u2019 does not exclude the possibility of the statement being true of all. It is evident that the term \u2018particular\u2019 has become distorted from its original meaning. It would naturally lead us to infer that a statement is limited to part of the subject, whereas, by its being opposed to universal, in the sense in which that term has been defined, it can only mean that we have nothing to show us whether part or the whole is spoken of.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 8, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      Deductive Logic    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "George William Joseph Stock, M.A.", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/189.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        83,149      ", "iid": "189", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//189/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Stock, G.

{"section_text": "\n\t264. It is important to notice the difference between Extensive and Intensive propositions; but this is not a division of propositions, but a distinction as to our way of regarding them. Propositions may be read either in extension or intension. Thus when we say \u2018All cows are ruminants,\u2019 we may mean that the class, cow, is contained in the larger class, ruminant. This is reading the proposition in extension. Or we may mean that the attribute of chewing the cud is contained in, or accompanies, the attributes which make up our idea of \u2018cow.\u2019 This is reading the proposition in intension. What, as a matter of fact, we do mean, is a mixture of the two, namely, that the class, cow, has the attribute of chewing the cud. For in the ordinary and natural form of proposition the subject is used in extension, and the predicate in intension, that is to say, when we use a subject, we are thinking of certain objects, whereas when we use a predicate, we indicate the possession of certain attributes. The predicate, however, need not always be used in intension, e.g. in the proposition \u2018His name is John\u2019 the predicate is not intended to convey the idea of any attributes at all. What is meant to be asserted is that the name of the person in question is that particular name, John, and not Zacharias or Abinadab or any other name that might be given him.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 8, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      Deductive Logic    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "George William Joseph Stock, M.A.", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/189.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        83,149      ", "iid": "189", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//189/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Stock, G.

{"section_text": "\n\t307. The attempt to take the predicate in extension, instead of, as it should naturally be taken, in intension, leads to some curious results. Let us take, for instance, the u proposition. Either the sign of quantity \u2018all\u2019 must be understood as forming part of the predicate or not. If it is not, then the u proposition \u2018All A is all B\u2019 seems to contain within itself, not one proposition, but two, namely, \u2018All A is B\u2019 and \u2018All B is A.\u2019 But if on the other hand \u2018all\u2019 is understood to form part of the predicate, then u is not really a general but a singular proposition. When we say, \u2018All men are rational animals,\u2019 we have a true general proposition, because the predicate applies to the subject distributively, and not collectively. What we mean is that \u2018rational animal\u2019 may be affirmed of every individual in the class, man. But when we say \u2018All men are all rational animals,\u2019 the predicate no longer applies to the subject distributively, but only collectively. For it is obvious that \u2018all rational animals\u2019 cannot be affirmed of every individual in the class, man.

As a consequence every proposition would admit of simple conversion, that is to say, of having the subject and predicate transposed without any further change in the proposition. The forms also of Reduction (a term which will be explained later on) would be simplified; and generally the introduction of the quantified predicate into logic might be attended with certain mechanical advantages. The object of the logician, however, is not to invent an ingenious system, but to arrive at a true analysis of thought. Now, if it be admitted that in the ordinary form of proposition the subject is used in extension and the predicate in intension, the ground for the doctrine is at once cut away.

If the five heads of predicables above given were offered to us as an exhaustive classification of the possible relations in which the predicate can stand to the subject in a proposition, the first thing that would strike us is that they do not cover the case in which the predicate is a singular term. In such a proposition as \u2018This man is John,\u2019 we have neither a predication of genus or species nor of attribute: but merely the identification of one term with another, as applying to the same object. Such criticism as this, however, would be entirely erroneous, since no singular term was regarded as a predicate. A predicable was another name for a universal, the common term being called a predicable in one relation and a universal in another-a predicable, extensively, in so far as it was applicable to several different things, a universal, intensively, in so far as the attributes indicated were implied in several other notions, as the attributes indicated by \u2018animal\u2019 are implied in \u2018horse,\u2019 \u2018sheep,\u2019 \u2018goat,\u2019 &c.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 11, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      Deductive Logic    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "George William Joseph Stock, M.A.", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/189.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        83,149      ", "iid": "189", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//189/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Stock, G.

Thus \u2018man\u2019 is usually contrasted with \u2018brute,\u2019 and from this point of view it is held a sufficient definition of him to say that he is \u2018a rational animal,\u2019 But a theologian might be more anxious to contrast man with supposed incorporeal intelligences, and from this point of view man would be defined as an \u2018embodied spirit.\u2019", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 12, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      Deductive Logic    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "George William Joseph Stock, M.A.", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/189.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        83,149      ", "iid": "189", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//189/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Stock, G.

Nature\u2019s classes moreover shade off into one another by such imperceptible degrees that it is often impossible to fix the boundary line between one class and another. A still greater source of perplexity in dealing with real kinds is that it is sometimes almost impossible to fix upon any attribute which is common to every individual member of the class without exception. All that we can do in such cases is to lay down a type of the class in its perfect form, and judge of individual instances by the degree of their approximation to it. Again, real kinds being known to us primarily in extension, the intension which we attach to the names is hable to be affected by the advance of knowledge. In dealing therefore with such terms we must be content with provisional definitions, which adequately express our knowledge of the things denoted by them, at the time, though a further study of their attributes may induce us subsequently to alter the definition.

But this amounts merely to saying that a definition should be a definition; since it is only by the aid of definition that we can distinguish between essential and non-essential among the common attributes exhibited by a class of things. The rule however may be retained as a material test of the soundness of a definition, in the sense that he who seeks to define anything should fix upon its most important attributes. To define man as a mammiferous animal having two hands, or as a featherless biped, we feel to be absurd and incongruous, since there is no reference to the most salient characteristic of man, namely, his rationality. Nevertheless we cannot quarrel with these definitions on formal, but only on material grounds. Again, if anyone chose to define logic as the art of thinking, all we could say is that we differ from him in opinion, as we think logic is more properly to be regarded as the science of the laws of thought.

Since the attributes in which members of the same class differ from one another cannot possibly be indicated by their common name, they must be sought for by the aid of experience; or, to put the same thing in other words, since all the infimae species are alike contained under the summum genus, their distinctive attributes can be no more than separable accidents when viewed in relation to the summum genus. Hence division, being always founded on the possession or non-possession of accidental attributes, seems to lie wholly outside the sphere of formal logic. This however is not quite the case, for, in virtue of the Law of Excluded Middle, there is always open to us, independently of experience, a hypothetical division by dichotomy. By dichotomy is meant a division into two classes by a pair of contradictory terms, e.g. a division of the class, man, into white and not-white. Now we cannot know, independently of experience, that any members of the class, man, possess whiteness; but we may be quite sure, independently of all experience, that men are either white or not. Hence division by dichotomy comes strictly within the province of formal logic. Only it must be noticed that both sides of the division must be hypothetical. For experience alone can tell us, on the one hand, that there are any men that are white, and on the other, that there are any but white men.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 13, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      Deductive Logic    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "George William Joseph Stock, M.A.", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/189.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        83,149      ", "iid": "189", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//189/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Stock, G.

To be suddenly thrown back upon the strictly particular view of I and O in the special case of opposition, after having been accustomed to regard them as indefinite propositions, is a manifest inconvenience. But the received doctrine of opposition does not even adhere consistently to this view. For if I and O be taken as strictly particular propositions, which exclude the possibility of the universal of the same quality being true along with them, we ought not merely to say that I and O may both be true, but that if one be true the other must also be true. For I being true, A is false, and therefore O is true; and we may argue similarly from the truth of O to the truth of I, through the falsity of E. Or\u2014to put the Same thing in a less abstract form\u2014since the strictly particular proposition means \u2018some, but not all,\u2019 it follows that the truth of one sub-contrary necessarily carries with it the truth of the other, If we lay down that some islands only are inhabited, it evidently follows, or rather is stated simultaneously, that there are some islands also which are not inhabited.

For this reason-that all the moods of the fourth figure can be elicited out of premisses in which the terms stand in the order of the first, whereas the converse is not the case. If, while retaining the quantity and quality of the above premisses, i. e. the mood, we were in each case to transpose the terms, we should find that we were left with five valid moods instead of six, since AI in the reverse order of the terms involves undistributed middle; and, though we should have Celarent indirect to Camenes, and Darii to Dimaris, we should never arrive at the conclusion of Barbara or have anything exactly equivalent to Ferio. In place of Barbara, Bramantip would yield as an indirect mood only the subaltern AAI in the first figure. Both Fesapo and Fresison would result in an illicit process, if we attempted to extract the conclusion of Ferio from them as an indirect mood. The nearest approach we could make to Ferio would be the mood EAO in the first figure, which may be elicited indirectly from the premisses of CAMENES, being subaltern to CELARENT. For these reasons the moods of the fourth figure are rightly to be regarded as indirect moods of the first, and not vice versa.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 30, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      Deductive Logic    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "George William Joseph Stock, M.A.", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/189.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        83,149      ", "iid": "189", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//189/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Stock, G.

{"section_text": "\n\t708. It is true that the disjunctive proposition, more than any other form, except U, seems to convey two statements in one breath. Yet it ought not, any more than the E proposition, to be regarded as conveying both with equal directness. The proposition \u2018No A is B\u2019 is not considered to assert directly, but only implicitly, that \u2018No B is A.\u2019 In the same way the form \u2018Either A is B or C is D\u2019 ought to be interpreted as meaning directly no more than this, \u2018If A is not B, C is D.\u2019 It asserts indeed by implication also that \u2018If C is not D, A is B.\u2019 But this is an immediate inference, being, as we shall presently see, the contrapositive of the original. When we say \u2018So and so is either a knave or a fool,\u2019 what we are directly asserting is that, if he be not found to be a knave, he will be found to be a fool. By implication we make the further statement that, if he be not cleared of folly, he will stand condemned of knavery. This inference is so immediate that it seems indistinguishable from the former proposition: but since the two members of a complex proposition play the part of subject and predicate, to say that the two statements are identical would amount to asserting that the same proposition can have two subjects and two predicates. From this point of view it becomes clear that there is no difference but one of expression between the disjunctive and the conjunctive proposition. The disjunctive is merely a peculiar way of stating a conjunctive proposition with a negative antecedent.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 32, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      Deductive Logic    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "George William Joseph Stock, M.A.", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/189.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        83,149      ", "iid": "189", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//189/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Stock, G.

When reduced in this manner to the simple type of argument, it will be found that the constructive conjunctive conforms to the first figure and the destructive conjunctive to the second.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 35, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      Deductive Logic    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "George William Joseph Stock, M.A.", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/189.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        83,149      ", "iid": "189", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//189/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Stock, G.

The dilemma, it will be seen, differs from the partly conjunctive syllogism chiefly in the fact of having a disjunctive affirmation of the antecedent or denial of the consequent in the minor, instead of a simple one. It is this which constitutes the essence of the dilemma, and which determines its possible varieties. For if only the antecedent or only the consequent be more than one, we must, in order to obtain a disjunctive minor, affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent respectively; whereas, if there be more than one of both, it is open to us to take either course.

Alt. v. 10), Euathlus was a pupil of Protagoras in rhetoric. He paid half the fee demanded by his preceptor before receiving lessons, and agreed to pay the remainder when he won his first case. But as he never proceeded to practise at the bar, it became evident that he meant to bilk his tutor. Accordingly Protagoras himself instituted a law-suit against him, and in the preliminary proceedings before the jurors propounded to him the following dilemma\u2014\u2019Most foolish young man, whatever be the issue of this suit, you must pay me what I claim: for, if the verdict be given in your favour, you are bound by our bargain; and if it be given against you, you are bound by the decision of the jurors.\u2019 The pupil, however, was equal to the occasion, and rebutted the dilemma as follows. \u2018Most sapient master, whatever be the issue of this suit, I shall not pay you what you claim: for, if the verdict be given in my favour, I am absolved by the decision of the jurors; and, if it be given against me, I am absolved by our bargain.\u2019 The jurors are said to have been so puzzled by the conflicting plausibility of the arguments that they adjourned the case till the Greek Kalends. It is evident, however, that a grave injustice was thus done to Protagoras. His dilemma was really invincible. In the counter-dilemma of Euathlus we are meant to infer that Protagoras would actually lose his fee, instead of merely getting it in one way rather than another. In either case he would both get and lose his fee, in the sense of getting it on one plea, and not getting it on another: but in neither case would he actually lose it.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 40, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      Deductive Logic    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "George William Joseph Stock, M.A.", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/189.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        83,149      ", "iid": "189", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//189/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Stock, G.

It is called by Aristotle [Greek: to aplos tode e pe legestai kai me kupios] or, more briefly, [Greek: to aplos e me], or [Greek: to pe kai aplos], and by the Latin writers \u2018Fallacia a dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter.\u2019 It consists in taking what is said in a particular respect as though it held true without any restriction, e.g., that because the nonexistent ([Greek: to me on]) is a matter of opinion, that therefore the non-existent is, or again that because the existent ([Greek: to on]) is not a man, that therefore the existent is not. Or again, if an Indian, who as a whole is black, has white teeth, we should be committing this species of fallacy in declaring him to be both white and not-white. For he is only white in a certain respect ([Greek: pe]), but not absolutely ([Greek: aplos]). More difficulty, says Aristotle, may arise when opposite qualities exist in a thing in about an equal degree. When, for instance, a thing is half white and half black, are we to say that it is white or black? This question the philosopher propounds, but does not answer. The force of it lies in the implied attack on the Law of Contradiction. It would seem in such a case that a thing may be both white and not-white at the same time.

The \u2018argumentum ad judicium\u2019 would take miracles as a whole, and endeavour to sift the amount of truth which may lie in the accounts we have of them in every age.
