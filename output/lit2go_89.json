Finn, a Frisian chieftain, who nevertheless has a \"castle\" outside the Frisian border, marries Hildeburh, a Danish prin- cess; and her brother, Hnaef, with many other Danes, pays Finn a visit. Relations between the two peoples have been strained before. Something starts the old feud anew; and the visitors are attacked in their quarters. Hnaef is killed; so is a son of Hildeburh. Many fall on both sides. Peace is patched up; a stately funeral is held; and the surviving visitors become in a way vassals or liegemen of Finn, going back with him to Frisia. So matters rest a while. Hengest is now leader of the Danes; but he is set upon revenge for his former lord, Hnaef. Probably he is killed in feud; but his clansmen, Guthlaf and Oslaf, gather at their home a force of sturdy Danes, come back to Frisia, storm Finn's stronghold, kill him, and carry back their kinswoman Hildeburh.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 16, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      Beowulf    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Francis Barton Gummere", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/89.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        26,548      ", "iid": "89", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//89/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Gummere, F.B.
