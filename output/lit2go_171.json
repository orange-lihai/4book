{"section_text": "\n\tIchabod Crane had a soft and foolish heart towards the sex; and it is not to be wondered at that so tempting a morsel soon found favor in his eyes, more especially after he had visited her in her paternal mansion. Old Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving, contented, liberal-hearted farmer. He seldom, it is true, sent either his eyes or his thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm; but within those everything was snug, happy and well-conditioned. He was satisfied with his wealth, but not proud of it; and piqued himself upon the hearty abundance, rather than the style in which he lived. His stronghold was situated on the banks of the Hudson, in one of those green, sheltered, fertile nooks in which the Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling. A great elm tree spread its broad branches over it, at the foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water, in a little well formed of a barrel; and then stole sparkling away through the grass, to a neighboring brook, that babbled along among alders and dwarf willows. Hard by the farmhouse was a vast barn, that might have served for a church; every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the treasures of the farm; the flail was busily resounding within it from morning to night; swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the eaves; and rows of pigeons, some with one eye turned up, as if watching the weather, some with their heads under their wings or buried in their bosoms, and others swelling, and cooing, and bowing about their dames, were enjoying the sunshine on the roof. Sleek unwieldy porkers were grunting in the repose and abundance of their pens, from whence sallied forth, now and then, troops of sucking pigs, as if to snuff the air. A stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond, convoying whole fleets of ducks; regiments of turkeys were gobbling through the farmyard, and Guinea fowls fretting about it, like ill-tempered housewives, with their peevish, discontented cry. Before the barn door strutted the gallant cock, that pattern of a husband, a warrior and a fine gentleman, clapping his burnished wings and crowing in the pride and gladness of his heart,\u2014sometimes tearing up the earth with his feet, and then generously calling his ever-hungry family of wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 0, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      American Short Fiction    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "FCIT", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/171.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        48,385      ", "iid": "171", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//171/", "source": "\nSource:\n      This book was compiled by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology and includes passages from multiple sources.

It was one of those spacious farmhouses, with high- ridged but lowly sloping roofs, built in the style handed down from the first Dutch settlers; the low projecting eaves forming a piazza along the front, capable of being closed up in bad weather. Under this were hung flails, harness, various utensils of husbandry, and nets for fishing in the neighboring river. Benches were built along the sides for summer use; and a great spinning-wheel at one end, and a churn at the other, showed the various uses to which this important porch might be devoted. From this piazza the wondering Ichabod entered the hall, which formed the centre of the mansion, and the place of usual residence. Here rows of resplendent pewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzled his eyes. In one corner stood a huge bag of wool, ready to be spun; in another, a quantity of linsey-woolsey just from the loom; ears of Indian corn, and strings of dried apples and peaches, hung in gay festoons along the walls, mingled with the gaud of red peppers; and a door left ajar gave him a peep into the best parlor, where the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables shone like mirrors; andirons, with their accompanying shovel and tongs, glistened from their covert of asparagus tops; mock- oranges and conch-shells decorated the mantelpiece; strings of various-colored birds eggs were suspended above it; a great ostrich egg was hung from the centre of the room, and a corner cupboard, knowingly left open, displayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended china.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 0, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      American Short Fiction    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "FCIT", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/171.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        48,385      ", "iid": "171", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//171/", "source": "\nSource:\n      This book was compiled by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology and includes passages from multiple sources.

From his Herculean frame and great powers of limb he had received the nickname of Brom Bones, by which he was universally known. He was famed for great knowledge and skill in horsemanship, being as dexterous on horseback as a Tartar. He was foremost at all races and cock fights; and, with the ascendancy which bodily strength always acquires in rustic life, was the umpire in all disputes, setting his hat on one side, and giving his decisions with an air and tone that admitted of no gainsay or appeal. He was always ready for either a fight or a frolic; but had more mischief than ill-will in his composition; and with all his overbearing roughness, there was a strong dash of waggish good humor at bottom. He had three or four boon companions, who regarded him as their model, and at the head of whom he scoured the country, attending every scene of feud or merriment for miles round. In cold weather he was distinguished by a fur cap, surmounted with a flaunting fox\u2019s tail; and when the folks at a country gathering descried this well-known crest at a distance, whisking about among a squad of hard riders, they always stood by for a squall. Sometimes his crew would be heard dashing along past the farmhouses at midnight, with whoop and halloo, like a troop of Don Cossacks; and the old dames, startled out of their sleep, would listen for a moment till the hurry-scurry had clattered by, and then exclaim, \u201cAy, there goes Brom Bones and his gang!\u201d The neighbors looked upon him with a mixture of awe, admiration, and good-will; and, when any madcap prank or rustic brawl occurred in the vicinity, always shook their heads, and warranted Brom Bones was at the bottom of it.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 0, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      American Short Fiction    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "FCIT", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/171.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        48,385      ", "iid": "171", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//171/", "source": "\nSource:\n      This book was compiled by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology and includes passages from multiple sources.

It is a great triumph of skill to gain the former, but a still greater proof of generalship to maintain possession of the latter, for man must battle for his fortress at every door and window. He who wins a thousand common hearts is therefore entitled to some renown; but he who keeps undisputed sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero.

Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice recently inflicted, for his scholars were all busily intent upon their books, or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the master; and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the schoolroom. It was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a negro in tow-cloth jacket and trowsers, a round-crowned fragment of a hat, like the cap of Mercury, and mounted on the back of a ragged, wild, half-broken colt, which he managed with a rope by way of halter.

There was a contagion in the very air that blew from that haunted region; it breathed forth an atmosphere of dreams and fancies infecting all the land. Several of the Sleepy Hollow people were present at Van Tassel\u2019s, and, as usual, were doling out their wild and wonderful legends. Many dismal tales were told about funeral trains, and mourning cries and wailings heard and seen about the great tree where the unfortunate Major Andr\u00e9 was taken, and which stood in the neighborhood. Some mention was made also of the woman in white, that haunted the dark glen at Raven Rock, and was often heard to shriek on winter nights before a storm, having perished there in the snow.

It stands on a knoll, surrounded by locust-trees and lofty elms, from among which its decent, whitewashed walls shine modestly forth, like Christian purity beaming through the shades of retirement. A gentle slope descends from it to a silver sheet of water, bordered by high trees, between which, peeps may be caught at the blue hills of the Hudson. To look upon its grass-grown yard, where the sunbeams seem to sleep so quietly, one would think that there at least the dead might rest in peace. On one side of the church extends a wide woody dell, along which raves a large brook among broken rocks and trunks of fallen trees. Over a deep black part of the stream, not far from the church, was formerly thrown a wooden bridge; the road that led to it, and the bridge itself, were thickly shaded by overhanging trees, which cast a gloom about it, even in the daytime; but occasioned a fearful darkness at night. Such was one of the favorite haunts of the Headless Horseman, and the place where he was most frequently encountered. The tale was told of old Brouwer, a most heretical disbeliever in ghosts, how he met the Horseman returning from his foray into Sleepy Hollow, and was obliged to get up behind him; how they galloped over bush and brake, over hill and swamp, until they reached the bridge; when the Horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton, threw old Brouwer into the brook, and sprang away over the tree-tops with a clap of thunder.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 0, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      American Short Fiction    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "FCIT", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/171.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        48,385      ", "iid": "171", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//171/", "source": "\nSource:\n      This book was compiled by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology and includes passages from multiple sources.

Ichabod, whose fears increased with the delay, jerked the reins on the other side, and kicked lustily with the contrary foot: it was all in vain; his steed started, it is true, but it was only to plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of brambles and alder bushes.

The last rim of the sun\u2019s red ball had sunk below the horizon line, and the western sky glowed with deep rose-color, which faded away above into pink, into the salmon-tint, into shades of that far-away heavenly emerald which the brush of the earthly artist can never reproduce, but which is found sometimes in the iridescent heart of the opal. The small town, a mile distant, stood turning its back on the cemetery; but the keeper could see the pleasant, rambling old mansions each with its rose-garden and neglected outlying fields, the empty negro quarters falling into ruin, and everything just as it stood when on that April morning the first gun was fired on Sumter; apparently not a nail added, not a brushful of paint applied, not a fallen brick replaced, or latch or lock repaired. The keeper had noted these things as he strolled through the town, but not with surprise; for he had seen the South in its first estate, when, fresh, strong, and fired with enthusiasm, he too had marched away from his village home with the colors flying above and the girls waving their handkerchiefs behind, as the regiment, a thousand strong, filed down the dusty road. That regiment, a weak, scarred two hundred, came back a year later with lagging step and colors tattered and scorched, and the girls could not wave their handkerchiefs, wet and sodden with tears. But the keeper, his wound healed, had gone again; and he had seen with his New England eyes the magnificence and the carelessness of the South, her splendor and negligence, her wealth and thriftlessness, as through Virginia and the fair Carolinas, across Georgia and into sunny Florida, he had marched month by month, first a lieutenant, then captain, and finally major and colonel, as death mowed down those above him, and he and his good conduct were left; everywhere magnificence went hand in hand with neglect, and he had said so as chance now and then threw a conversation in his path.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 3, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      American Short Fiction    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "FCIT", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/171.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        48,385      ", "iid": "171", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//171/", "source": "\nSource:\n      This book was compiled by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology and includes passages from multiple sources.

{"section_text": "\n\tThis still evening in early February he looked out over the level waste. The little town stood in the lowlands: there were no hills from whence cometh help\u2014calm heights that lift the soul above earth and its cares; no river to lead the aspirations of the children outward towards the great sea. Everything was monotonous, and the only spirit that rose above the waste was a bitterness for the gained and sorrow for the lost cause. The keeper was the only man whose presence personated the former in their sight, and upon him therefore, as representative, the bitterness fell, not in words, but in averted looks, in sudden silences when he approached, in withdrawals and avoidance, until he lived and moved in a vacuum; wherever he went there was presently no one save himself; the very shop-keeper who sold him sugar seemed turned into a man of wood, and took his money reluctantly, although the shilling gained stood perhaps for that day\u2019s family dinner. So Rodman withdrew himself, and came and went among them no more; the broad acres of his domain gave him as much exercise as his shattered ankle could bear; he ordered his few supplies by the quantity, and began the life of a solitary, his island marked out by the massive granite wall with which the United States government has carefully surrounded those sad Southern cemeteries of hers; sad, not so much from the number of the mounds representing youth and strength cut off in their bloom, for that is but the fortune of war, as for the complete isolation which marks them. \u201cStrangers in a strange land\u201d is the thought of all who, coming and going to and from Florida, turn aside here and there to stand for a moment among the closely ranged graves which seem already a part of the past, that near past which in our rushing American life is even now so far away. The government work was completed before the keeper came; the lines of the trenches were defined by low granite copings, and the comparatively few single mounds were headed by trim little white boards bearing generally the word \u201cunknown,\u201d but here and there a name and an age, in most cases a boy from some far-away Northern State; \u201ctwenty-one,\u201d \u201ctwenty-two,\u201d said the inscriptions; the dates were those dark years among the sixties, measured now more than by anything else in the number of maidens widowed in heart, and women widowed indeed, who sit still and remember, while the world rushes by. At sunrise the keeper ran up the stars and stripes, and so precise were his ideas of the accessories belonging to the place that from his own small store of money he had taken enough, by stinting himself, to buy a second flag for stormy weather, so that, rain or not, the colors should float over the dead. This was not patriotism so-called, or rather miscalled, it was not sentimental fancy, it was not zeal or triumph; it was simply a sense of the fitness of things, a conscientiousness which had in it nothing of religion, unless indeed a man\u2019s endeavor to live up to his own ideal of his duty be a religion. The same feeling led the keeper to spend hours in copying the rolls. \u201cJohn Andrew Warren, Company G, Eighth New Hampshire Infantry,\u201d he repeated, as he slowly wrote the name, giving \u201cJohn Andrew\u201d clear, bold capitals and a lettering impossible to mistake; \u201cdied August 15, 1863, aged twenty-two years. He came from the prison-pen yonder, and lies somewhere in those trenches, I suppose. Now then, John Andrew, don\u2019t fancy I am sorrowing for you; no doubt you are better off than I am at this very moment. But none the less, John Andrew, shall pen, ink, and hand do their duty to you.

The same spirit kept the grass carefully away from the low coping of the trenches, kept the graveled paths smooth and the mounds green, and the bare little cottage neat as a man-of-war; when the keeper cooked his dinner, the door towards the east, where the dead lay, was scrupulously closed, nor was it opened until everything was in perfect order again. At sunset the flag was lowered, and then it was the keeper\u2019s habit to walk slowly up and down the path until the shadows veiled the mounds on each side, and there was nothing save the peaceful green of earth. \u201cSo time will efface our little lives and sorrows,\u201d he mused, \u201cand we shall be as nothing in the indistinguishable past.\u201d Yet none the less did he fulfill the duties of every day and hour with exactness. \u201cAt least they shall not say that I was lacking,\u201d he murmured to himself as he thought vaguely of the future beyond these graves.

Hasty burials the prison authorities gave them; the thin, starved*** bodies were tumbled into the trenches by men almost as starved, for the whole State went hungry in those dark days. There were not many prayers, no tears, as the dead-carts went the rounds. But the prayers had been said, and the tears had fallen, while the poor fellows were still alive in the pens yonder; and when at last death came, it was like a release.

He would not allow himself the companionship of a dog lest the creature should bark at night and disturb the quiet.

He would not smoke, although he had the soldier\u2019s fondness for a pipe.

In the early dawn the keeper had performed his outdoor tasks, but all day he remained almost without stirring in his chair between two windows, striving to exist. At high noon out came a little black bringing his supplies from the town, whistling and shuffling along, gay as a lark; the keeper watched him coming slowly down the white road, loitering by the way in the hot blaze, stopping to turn a somersault or two, to dangle over a bridge rail, to execute various impromptu capers all by himself. He reached the gate at last, entered, and having come all the way up the path in a hornpipe step, he set down his basket at the door to indulge in one long and final double-shuffle before knocking. \u201cStop that!\u201d said the keeper through the closed blinds. The little darkey darted back; but as nothing further came out of the window,\u2014a boot, for instance, or some other stray missile,\u2014he took courage, showed his ivories, and drew near again. \u201cDo you suppose I am going to have you stirring up the heat in that way?\u201d demanded the keeper.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 3, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      American Short Fiction    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "FCIT", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/171.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        48,385      ", "iid": "171", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//171/", "source": "\nSource:\n      This book was compiled by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology and includes passages from multiple sources.

The keeper decided that his cemetery was a much more cheerful place than this, and then he looked around for the spring. Behind the house the ground sloped down; it must be there.

Cursing the incompetency in high places, cursing the mismanagement of the entire medical department of the Confederate army, cursing the recklessness and indifference which left the men suffering for want of proper hospitals and hospital stores, he yet went on resolutely doing his best with the poor means in his control until the last. Then he came home, he and his old horse, and went the rounds again, he prescribing for whooping-cough or measles, and Dobbin waiting outside; the only difference was that fees were small and good meals scarce for both, not only for the man but for the beast. The doctor sat down and chatted awhile kindly with De Rosset, whose father and uncle had been dear friends of his in the bright, prosperous days; then he left a few harmless medicines and rose to go, his gaze resting a moment on Miss Ward, then on Pomp, as if he were hesitating. But he said nothing until on the walk outside he met the keeper, and recognized a person to whom he could tell the truth. \u201cThere is nothing to be done; he may recover, he may not; it is a question of strength, merely. He needs no medicines, only nourishing food, rest, and careful tendance.\u201d", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 3, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      American Short Fiction    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "FCIT", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/171.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        48,385      ", "iid": "171", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//171/", "source": "\nSource:\n      This book was compiled by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology and includes passages from multiple sources.

{"section_text": "\n\tAll talk of moving De Rosset ceased, but Miss Ward moved into the old house. There was not much to move: herself, her one trunk, and Mar\u00ed, a black attendant, whose name probably began life as Maria, since the accent still dwelt on the curtailed last syllable. The keeper went there once, and once only, and then it was an errand for the sick man, whose fancies came sometimes at inconvenient hours,\u2014when Pomp had gone to town, for instance. On this occasion the keeper entered the mockery of a gate and knocked at the front door, from which the bars had been removed; the piazza still showed its decaying planks, but quick-growing summer vines had been planted, and were now encircling the old pillars and veiling all defects with their greenery. It was a woman\u2019s pathetic effort to cover up what cannot be covered\u2014poverty. The blinds on one side were open and white curtains waved to and fro in the breeze; into this room he was ushered by Mar\u00ed. Matting lay on the floor, streaked here and there ominously by the dampness from the near ground. The furniture was of dark mahogany, handsome in its day: chairs, a heavy pier table with low-down glass, into which no one by any possibility could look unless he had eyes in his ankles, a sofa with a stiff round pillow of hair-cloth under each curved end, and a mirror with a compartment framed off at the top, containing a picture of shepherds and shepherdesses, and lambs with blue ribbons around their necks, all enjoying themselves in the most natural and life-like manner. Flowers stood on the high mantelpiece, but their fragrance could not overcome the faint odor of the damp straw-matting. On a table were books, a life of General Lee, and three or four shabby little volumes printed at the South during the war, waifs of prose and poetry of that highly wrought, richly colored style which seems indigenous to Southern soil.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 3, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      American Short Fiction    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "FCIT", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/171.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        48,385      ", "iid": "171", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//171/", "source": "\nSource:\n      This book was compiled by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology and includes passages from multiple sources.

He had grown childishly dependent upon his host, and wearied for him, as the Scotch say; but Rodman withstood his fancies, and gave him only the evenings, when Miss Bettina was not there. One afternoon, however, it rained so violently that he was forced to seek shelter; he set himself to work on the ledgers; he was on the ninth thousand now. But the sick man heard his step in the outer room, and called in his weak voice, \u201cRodman,\u2014Rodman.\u201d After a time he went in, and it ended in his staying, for the patient was nervous and irritable, and he pitied the nurse, who seemed able to please him in nothing. De Rosset turned with a sigh of relief towards the strong hands that lifted him readily, towards the composed manner, towards the man\u2019s voice that seemed to bring a breeze from outside into the close room; animated, cheered, he talked volubly. The keeper listened, answered once in a while, and quietly took the rest of the afternoon into his own hands. Miss Ward yielded to the silent change, leaned back, and closed her eyes. She looked exhausted and for the first time pallid; the loosened dark hair curled in little rings about her temples, and her lips were parted as though she was too tired to close them; for hers were not the thin, straight lips that shut tight naturally, like the straight line of a closed box. The sick man talked on. \u201cCome, Rodman,\u201d he said, after a while, \u201cI have read that lying verse of yours over at least ten thousand and fifty-nine times; please tell me its history; I want to have something definite to think of when I read it for the ten thousand and sixtieth.\u201d", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 3, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      American Short Fiction    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "FCIT", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/171.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        48,385      ", "iid": "171", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//171/", "source": "\nSource:\n      This book was compiled by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology and includes passages from multiple sources.

{"section_text": "\n\t\u201cIt will be the truth, but not long. When the war broke out I was twenty-eight years old, living with my mother on our farm in New England. My father and two brothers had died and left me the homestead, otherwise I should have broken away and sought fortune farther westward, where the lands are better and life is more free. But mother loved the house, the fields, and every crooked tree. She was alone, and so I stayed with her. In the centre of the village green stood the square, white meeting-house, and near by the small cottage where the pastor lived; the minister\u2019s daughter, Mary, was my promised wife. Mary was a slender little creature with a profusion of pale flaxen hair, large, serious blue eyes, and small, delicate features; she was timid almost to a fault; her voice was low and gentle. She was not eighteen, and we were to wait a year. The war came, and I volunteered, of course, and marched away; we wrote to each other often; my letters were full of the camp and skirmishes; hers told of the village, how the widow Brown had fallen ill, and how it was feared that Squire Stafford\u2019s boys were lapsing into evil ways. Then came the day when my regiment marched to the field of its slaughter, and soon after our shattered remnant went home. Mary cried over me, and came out every day to the farm house with her bunches of violets; she read aloud to me from her good little books, and I used to lie and watch her profile bending over the page, with the light falling on her flaxen hair low down against the small, white throat. Then my wound healed, and I went again, this time for three years; and Mary\u2019s father blessed me, and said that when peace came he would call me son, but not before, for these were no times for marrying or giving in marriage. He was a good man, a red-hot abolitionist, and a roaring lion as regards temperance; but nature had made him so small in body that no one was much frightened when he roared. I said that I went for three years; but eight years have passed and I have never been back to the village. First, mother died. Then Mary turned false. I sold the farm by letter and lost the money three months afterwards in an unfortunate investment; my health failed. Like many another Northern soldier I remembered the healing climate of the South; its soft airs came back to me when the snow lay deep on the fields and the sharp wind whistled around the poor tavern where the moneyless, half-crippled volunteer sat coughing by the fire. I applied for this place and obtained it.

{"section_text": "\n\tOne afternoon of a cold winter\u2019s day, when the sun shone forth with chilly brightness, after a long storm, two children asked leave of their mother to run out and play in the new-fallen snow. The elder child was a girl, whom, because she was of a tender and modest disposition, and was thought to be very beautiful, her parents, and other people who were familiar with her, used to call Violet. But her brother was known by the style and title of Peony, on account of the ruddiness of his broad and round little phiz, which made everybody think of sunshine and great scarlet flowers. The father of these two children, a certain Mr. Lindsey, it is important to say, was an excellent but exceedingly matter-of-fact sort of man, a dealer in hardware, and was sturdily accustomed to take what is called the common-sense view of all matters that came under his consideration. With a heart about as tender as other people\u2019s, he had a head as hard and impenetrable, and therefore, perhaps, as empty, as one of the iron pots which it was a part of his business to sell. The mother\u2019s character, on the other hand, had a strain of poetry in it, a trait of unworldly beauty\u2014a delicate and dewy flower, as it were, that had survived out of her imaginative youth, and still kept itself alive amid the dusty realities of matrimony and motherhood.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 4, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      American Short Fiction    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "FCIT", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/171.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        48,385      ", "iid": "171", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//171/", "source": "\nSource:\n      This book was compiled by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology and includes passages from multiple sources.
