No drummers, from whom proceeded a melancholy chirping on the turning of a handle; no regiment of soldiers, with a mute band, taken out of a box, and fitted, one by one, upon a stiff and lazy little set of lazy\u2013tongs; no old woman, made of wires and a brown\u2013paper composition, cutting up a pie for two small children; could give me a permanent comfort, for a long time.

{"section_text": "\n\tThere is probably a smell of roasted chestnuts and other good comfortable things all the time, for we are telling Winter Stories\u2014 Ghost Stories, or more shame for us\u2014round the Christmas fire; and we have never stirred, except to draw a little nearer to it. But, no matter for that. We came to the house, and it is an old house, full of great chimneys where wood is burnt on ancient dogs upon the hearth, and grim portraits (some of them with grim legends, too) lower distrustfully from the oaken panels of the walls. We are a middle\u2013aged nobleman, and we make a generous supper with our host and hostess and their guests\u2014it being Christmas\u2013time, and the old house full of company\u2014and then we go to bed. Our room is a very old room. It is hung with tapestry. We don\u2019t like the portrait of a cavalier in green, over the fireplace. There are great black beams in the ceiling, and there is a great black bedstead, supported at the foot by two great black figures, who seem to have come off a couple of tombs in the old baronial church in the park, for our particular accommodation. But, we are not a superstitious nobleman, and we don\u2019t mind. Well! we dismiss our servant, lock the door, and sit before the fire in our dressing\u2013gown, musing about a great many things. At length we go to bed. Well! we can\u2019t sleep. We toss and tumble, and can\u2019t sleep. The embers on the hearth burn fitfully and make the room look ghostly. We can\u2019t help peeping out over the counterpane, at the two black figures and the cavalier\u2014that wicked\u2013 looking cavalier\u2014in green. In the flickering light they seem to advance and retire: which, though we are not by any means a superstitious nobleman, is not agreeable. Well! we get nervous\u2014 more and more nervous. We say \u201cThis is very foolish, but we can\u2019t stand this; we\u2019ll pretend to be ill, and knock up somebody.\u201d Well! we are just going to do it, when the locked door opens, and there comes in a young woman, deadly pale, and with long fair hair, who glides to the fire, and sits down in the chair we have left there, wringing her hands. Then, we notice that her clothes are wet. Our tongue cleaves to the roof of our mouth, and we can\u2019t speak; but, we observe her accurately. Her clothes are wet; her long hair is dabbled with moist mud; she is dressed in the fashion of two hundred years ago; and she has at her girdle a bunch of rusty keys. Well! there she sits, and we can\u2019t even faint, we are in such a state about it. Presently she gets up, and tries all the locks in the room with the rusty keys, which won\u2019t fit one of them; then, she fixes her eyes on the portrait of the cavalier in green, and says, in a low, terrible voice, \u201cThe stags know it!\u201d After that, she wrings her hands again, passes the bedside, and goes out at the door. We hurry on our dressing\u2013gown, seize our pistols (we always travel with pistols), and are following, when we find the door locked. We turn the key, look out into the dark gallery; no one there. We wander away, and try to find our servant. Can\u2019t be done. We pace the gallery till daybreak; then return to our deserted room, fall asleep, and are awakened by our servant (nothing ever haunts him) and the shining sun. Well! we make a wretched breakfast, and all the company say we look queer. After breakfast, we go over the house with our host, and then we take him to the portrait of the cavalier in green, and then it all comes out. He was false to a young housekeeper once attached to that family, and famous for her beauty, who drowned herself in a pond, and whose body was discovered, after a long time, because the stags refused to drink of the water. Since which, it has been whispered that she traverses the house at midnight (but goes especially to that room where the cavalier in green was wont to sleep), trying the old locks with the rusty keys. Well! we tell our host of what we have seen, and a shade comes over his features, and he begs it may be hushed up; and so it is.

Thus, it comes to pass, that a certain room in a certain old hall, where a certain bad lord, baronet, knight, or gentleman, shot himself, has certain planks in the floor from which the blood WILL NOT be taken out. You may scrape and scrape, as the present owner has done, or plane and plane, as his father did, or scrub and scrub, as his grandfather did, or burn and burn with strong acids, as his great\u2013 grandfather did, but, there the blood will still be\u2014no redder and no paler\u2014no more and no less\u2014always just the same. Thus, in such another house there is a haunted door, that never will keep open; or another door that never will keep shut, or a haunted sound of a spinning\u2013wheel, or a hammer, or a footstep, or a cry, or a sigh, or a horse\u2019s tramp, or the rattling of a chain. Or else, there is a turret\u2013clock, which, at the midnight hour, strikes thirteen when the head of the family is going to die; or a shadowy, immovable black carriage which at such a time is always seen by somebody, waiting near the great gates in the stable\u2013yard. Or thus, it came to pass how Lady Mary went to pay a visit at a large wild house in the Scottish Highlands, and, being fatigued with her long journey, retired to bed early, and innocently said, next morning, at the breakfast\u2013table, \u201cHow odd, to have so late a party last night, in this remote place, and not to tell me of it, before I went to bed!\u201d Then, every one asked Lady Mary what she meant? Then, Lady Mary replied, \u201cWhy, all night long, the carriages were driving round and round the terrace, underneath my window!\u201d Then, the owner of the house turned pale, and so did his Lady, and Charles Macdoodle of Macdoodle signed to Lady Mary to say no more, and every one was silent. After breakfast, Charles Macdoodle told Lady Mary that it was a tradition in the family that those rumbling carriages on the terrace betokened death. And so it proved, for, two months afterwards, the Lady of the mansion died. And Lady Mary, who was a Maid of Honour at Court, often told this story to the old Queen Charlotte; by this token that the old King always said, \u201cEh, eh? What, what? Ghosts, ghosts?

{"section_text": "\n\tOr, it was a certain sensible old maiden lady, who died at ninety\u2013 nine, and retained her faculties to the last, who really did see the Orphan Boy; a story which has often been incorrectly told, but, of which the real truth is this\u2014because it is, in fact, a story belonging to our family\u2014and she was a connexion of our family. When she was about forty years of age, and still an uncommonly fine woman (her lover died young, which was the reason why she never married, though she had many offers), she went to stay at a place in Kent, which her brother, an Indian\u2013Merchant, had newly bought. There was a story that this place had once been held in trust by the guardian of a young boy; who was himself the next heir, and who killed the young boy by harsh and cruel treatment. She knew nothing of that. It has been said that there was a Cage in her bedroom in which the guardian used to put the boy. There was no such thing. There was only a closet. She went to bed, made no alarm whatever in the night, and in the morning said composedly to her maid when she came in, \u201cWho is the pretty forlorn\u2013looking child who has been peeping out of that closet all night?\u201d The maid replied by giving a loud scream, and instantly decamping. She was surprised; but she was a woman of remarkable strength of mind, and she dressed herself and went downstairs, and closeted herself with her brother. \u201cNow, Walter,\u201d she said, \u201cI have been disturbed all night by a pretty, forlorn\u2013looking boy, who has been constantly peeping out of that closet in my room, which I can\u2019t open. This is some trick.\u201d \u201cI am afraid not, Charlotte,\u201d said he, \u201cfor it is the legend of the house. It is the Orphan Boy. What did he do?\u201d \u201cHe opened the door softly,\u201d said she, \u201cand peeped out. Sometimes, he came a step or two into the room. Then, I called to him, to encourage him, and he shrunk, and shuddered, and crept in again, and shut the door.\u201d \u201cThe closet has no communication, Charlotte,\u201d said her brother, \u201cwith any other part of the house, and it\u2019s nailed up.\u201d This was undeniably true, and it took two carpenters a whole forenoon to get it open, for examination. Then, she was satisfied that she had seen the Orphan Boy. But, the wild and terrible part of the story is, that he was also seen by three of her brother\u2019s sons, in succession, who all died young. On the occasion of each child being taken ill, he came home in a heat, twelve hours before, and said, Oh, Mamma, he had been playing under a particular oak\u2013tree, in a certain meadow, with a strange boy\u2014a pretty, forlorn\u2013looking boy, who was very timid, and made signs! From fatal experience, the parents came to know that this was the Orphan Boy, and that the course of that child whom he chose for his little playmate was surely run.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 1, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      Dickens' Christmas Stories    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "FCIT", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/67.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        23,033      ", "iid": "67", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//67/", "source": "\nSource:\n      This book was compiled by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology and includes passages from multiple sources.

{"section_text": "\n\tNo period within the four-and-twenty hours of day and night is so solemn to me, as the early morning. In the summer-time, I often rise very early, and repair to my room to do a day\u2019s work before breakfast, and I am always on those occasions deeply impressed by the stillness and solitude around me. Besides that there is something awful in the being surrounded by familiar faces asleep\u2014in the knowledge that those who are dearest to us and to whom we are dearest, are profoundly unconscious of us, in an impassive state, anticipative of that mysterious condition to which we are all tending\u2014the stopped life, the broken threads of yesterday, the deserted seat, the closed book, the unfinished but abandoned occupation, all are images of Death. The tranquillity of the hour is the tranquillity of Death. The colour and the chill have the same association. Even a certain air that familiar household objects take upon them when they first emerge from the shadows of the night into the morning, of being newer, and as they used to be long ago, has its counterpart in the subsidence of the worn face of maturity or age, in death, into the old youthful look. Moreover, I once saw the apparition of my father, at this hour. He was alive and well, and nothing ever came of it, but I saw him in the daylight, sitting with his back towards me, on a seat that stood beside my bed. His head was resting on his hand, and whether he was slumbering or grieving, I could not discern. Amazed to see him there, I sat up, moved my position, leaned out of bed, and watched him. As he did not move, I spoke to him more than once. As he did not move then, I became alarmed and laid my hand upon his shoulder, as I thought\u2014and there was no such thing.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 3, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      Dickens' Christmas Stories    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "FCIT", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/67.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        23,033      ", "iid": "67", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//67/", "source": "\nSource:\n      This book was compiled by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology and includes passages from multiple sources.

Moreover, I had lived in two haunted houses\u2014both abroad. In one of these, an old Italian palace, which bore the reputation of being very badly haunted indeed, and which had recently been twice abandoned on that account, I lived eight months, most tranquilly and pleasantly: notwithstanding that the house had a score of mysterious bedrooms, which were never used, and possessed, in one large room in which I sat reading, times out of number at all hours, and next to which I slept, a haunted chamber of the first pretensions. I gently hinted these considerations to the landlord. And as to this particular house having a bad name, I reasoned with him, Why, how many things had bad names undeservedly, and how easy it was to give bad names, and did he not think that if he and I were persistently to whisper in the village that any weird-looking old drunken tinker of the neighbourhood had sold himself to the Devil, he would come in time to be suspected of that commercial venture!

Let me do Ikey no injustice. He was afraid of the house, and believed in its being haunted; and yet he would play false on the haunting side, so surely as he got an opportunity. The Odd Girl\u2019s case was exactly similar.

{"section_text": "\n\tFirst\u2014to get my sister and myself out of the way\u2014there were we two. In the drawing of lots, my sister drew her own room, and I drew Master B.\u2018s. Next, there was our first cousin John Herschel, so called after the great astronomer: than whom I suppose a better man at a telescope does not breathe. With him, was his wife: a charming creature to whom he had been married in the previous spring. I thought it (under the circumstances) rather imprudent to bring her, because there is no knowing what even a false alarm may do at such a time; but I suppose he knew his own business best, and I must say that if she had been MY wife, I never could have left her endearing and bright face behind. They drew the Clock Room. Alfred Starling, an uncommonly agreeable young fellow of eight-and-twenty for whom I have the greatest liking, was in the Double Room; mine, usually, and designated by that name from having a dressing-room within it, with two large and cumbersome windows, which no wedges I was ever able to make, would keep from shaking, in any weather, wind or no wind. Alfred is a young fellow who pretends to be \u201cfast\u201d (another word for loose, as I understand the term), but who is much too good and sensible for that nonsense, and who would have distinguished himself before now, if his father had not unfortunately left him a small independence of two hundred a year, on the strength of which his only occupation in life has been to spend six. I am in hopes, however, that his Banker may break, or that he may enter into some speculation guaranteed to pay twenty per cent.; for, I am convinced that if he could only be ruined, his fortune is made. Belinda Bates, bosom friend of my sister, and a most intellectual, amiable, and delightful girl, got the Picture Room. She has a fine genius for poetry, combined with real business earnestness, and \u201cgoes in\u201d\u2014to use an expression of Alfred\u2019s\u2014for Woman\u2019s mission, Woman\u2019s rights, Woman\u2019s wrongs, and everything that is woman\u2019s with a capital W, or is not and ought to be, or is and ought not to be. \u201cMost praiseworthy, my dear, and Heaven prosper you!\u201d I whispered to her on the first night of my taking leave of her at the Picture-Room door, \u201cbut don\u2019t overdo it. And in respect of the great necessity there is, my darling, for more employments being within the reach of Woman than our civilisation has as yet assigned to her, don\u2019t fly at the unfortunate men, even those men who are at first sight in your way, as if they were the natural oppressors of your sex; for, trust me, Belinda, they do sometimes spend their wages among wives and daughters, sisters, mothers, aunts, and grandmothers; and the play is, really, not ALL Wolf and Red Riding-Hood, but has other parts in it.\u201d However, I digress.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 3, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      Dickens' Christmas Stories    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "FCIT", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/67.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        23,033      ", "iid": "67", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//67/", "source": "\nSource:\n      This book was compiled by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology and includes passages from multiple sources.
