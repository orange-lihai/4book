{"section_text": "\n\t\u201cOh, Marilla, I\u2019ve had a most FASCINATING time. I feel that I have not lived in vain and I shall always feel like that even if I should never be invited to tea at a manse again. When I got there Mrs. Allan met me at the door. She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy, with dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she looked just like a seraph. I really think I\u2019d like to be a minister\u2019s wife when I grow up, Marilla. A minister mightn\u2019t mind my red hair because he wouldn\u2019t be thinking of such worldly things. But then of course one would have to be naturally good and I\u2019ll never be that, so I suppose there\u2019s no use in thinking about it. Some people are naturally good, you know, and others are not. I\u2019m one of the others. Mrs. Lynde says I\u2019m full of original sin. No matter how hard I try to be good I can never make such a success of it as those who are naturally good. It\u2019s a good deal like geometry, I expect. But don\u2019t you think the trying so hard ought to count for something? Mrs. Allan is one of the naturally good people. I love her passionately. You know there are some people, like Matthew and Mrs. Allan that you can love right off without any trouble. And there are others, like Mrs. Lynde, that you have to try very hard to love. You know you OUGHT to love them because they know so much and are such active workers in the church, but you have to keep reminding yourself of it all the time or else you forget. There was another little girl at the manse to tea, from the White Sands Sunday school. Her name was Laurette Bradley, and she was a very nice little girl. Not exactly a kindred spirit, you know, but still very nice. We had an elegant tea, and I think I kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well. After tea Mrs. Allan played and sang and she got Lauretta and me to sing too. Mrs. Allan says I have a good voice and she says I must sing in the Sunday-school choir after this. You can\u2019t think how I was thrilled at the mere thought. I\u2019ve longed so to sing in the Sunday-school choir, as Diana does, but I feared it was an honor I could never aspire to. Lauretta had to go home early because there is a big concert in the White Sands Hotel tonight and her sister is to recite at it. Lauretta says that the Americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and they ask lots of the White Sands people to recite. Lauretta said she expected to be asked herself someday. I just gazed at her in awe. After she had gone Mrs. Allan and I had a heart-to-heart talk. I told her everything\u2014about Mrs. Thomas and the twins and Katie Maurice and Violetta and coming to Green Gables and my troubles over geometry. And would you believe it, Marilla? Mrs. Allan told me she was a dunce at geometry too. You don\u2019t know how that encouraged me. Mrs. Lynde came to the manse just before I left, and what do you think, Marilla? The trustees have hired a new teacher and it\u2019s a lady. Her name is Miss Muriel Stacy. Isn\u2019t that a romantic name? Mrs. Lynde says they\u2019ve never had a female teacher in Avonlea before and she thinks it is a dangerous innovation. But I think it will be splendid to have a lady teacher, and I really don\u2019t see how I\u2019m going to live through the two weeks before school begins. I\u2019m so impatient to see her.\u201d", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 21, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        Canada      ", "name": "      Anne of Green Gables    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Lucy Maude Montgomery", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/53.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        114,355      ", "iid": "53", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//53/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Montgomery, L.M.
