I chafed at first, and then, under the hypnotising effect of routine, gradually began to find a grim satisfaction in the life. During the early part of my stay I had been struck by the contrast between the vitality of the climate and the deadness of the community. Day by day, after the December snows were over, a blazing blue sky poured down torrents of light and air on the white landscape, which gave them back in an intenser glitter.

When I had been there a little longer, and had seen this phase of crystal clearness followed by long stretches of sunless cold; when the storms of February had pitched their white tents about the. devoted village and the wild cavalry of March winds had charged down to their support; I began to understand why Starkfield emerged from its six months\u2019 siege like a starved garrison capitulating without quarter. Twenty years earlier the means of resistance must have been far fewer, and the enemy in command of almost all the lines of access between the beleaguered villages; and, considering these things, I felt the sinister force of Harmon\u2019s phrase: \u201cMost of the smart ones get away.\u201d But if that were the case, how could any combination of obstacles have hindered the flight of a man like Ethan Frome?", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 0, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      Ethan Frome    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Edith Wharton", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/126.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        37,665      ", "iid": "126", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//126/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Wharton, E.

He never turned his face to mine, or answered, except in monosyllables, the questions I put, or such slight pleasantries as I ventured. He seemed a part of the mute melancholy landscape, an incarnation of its frozen woe, with all that was warm and sentient in him fast bound below the surface; but there was nothing unfriendly in his silence. I simply felt that he lived in a depth of moral isolation too remote for casual access, and I had the sense that his loneliness was not merely the result of his personal plight, tragic as I guessed that to be, but had in it, as Harmon Gow had hinted, the profound accumulated cold of many Starkfield winters.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 0, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      Ethan Frome    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Edith Wharton", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/126.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        37,665      ", "iid": "126", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//126/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Wharton, E.

{"section_text": "\n\tIt was during their night walks back to the farm that he felt most intensely the sweetness of this communion. He had always been more sensitive than the people about him to the appeal of natural beauty. His unfinished studies had given form to this sensibility and even in his unhappiest moments field and sky spoke to him with a deep and powerful persuasion. But hitherto the emotion had remained in him as a silent ache, veiling with sadness the beauty that evoked it. He did not even know whether any one else in the world felt as he did, or whether he was the sole victim of this mournful privilege. Then he learned that one other spirit had trembled with the same touch of wonder: that at his side, living under his roof and eating his bread, was a creature to whom he could say: \u201cThat\u2019s Orion down yonder; the big fellow to the right is Aldebaran, and the bunch of little ones- like bees swarming- they\u2019re the Pleiades\u2026\u201d or whom he could hold entranced before a ledge of granite thrusting up through the fern while he unrolled the huge panorama of the ice age, and the long dim stretches of succeeding time. The fact that admiration for his learning mingled with Mattie\u2019s wonder at what he taught was not the least part of his pleasure. And there were other sensations, less definable but more exquisite, which drew them together with a shock of silent joy: the cold red of sunset behind winter hills, the flight of cloud-flocks over slopes of golden stubble, or the intensely blue shadows of hemlocks on sunlit snow. When she said to him once: \u201cIt looks just as if it was painted!\u201d it seemed to Ethan that the art of definition could go no farther, and that words had at last been found to utter his secret soul\u2026.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 1, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      Ethan Frome    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Edith Wharton", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/126.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        37,665      ", "iid": "126", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//126/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Wharton, E.

The face she lifted to her dancers was the same which, when she saw him, always looked like a window that has caught the sunset.

His wife had never shown any jealousy of Mattie, but of late she had grumbled increasingly over the house-work and found oblique ways of attracting attention to the girl\u2019s inefficiency. Zeena had always been what Starkfield called \u201csickly,\u201d and Frome had to admit that, if she were as ailing as she believed, she needed the help of a stronger arm than the one which lay so lightly in his during the night walks to the farm. Mattie had no natural turn for housekeeping, and her training had done nothing to remedy the defect. She was quick to learn, but forgetful and dreamy, and not disposed to take the matter seriously. Ethan had an idea that if she were to marry a man she was fond of the dormant instinct would wake, and her pies and biscuits become the pride of the county; but domesticity in the abstract did not interest her. At first she was so awkward that he could not help laughing at her; but she laughed with him and that made them better friends. He did his best to supplement her unskilled efforts, getting up earlier than usual to light the kitchen fire, carrying in the wood overnight, and neglecting the mill for the farm that he might help her about the house during the day. He even crept down on Saturday nights to scrub the kitchen floor after the women had gone to bed; and Zeena, one day, had surprised him at the churn and had turned away silently, with one of her queer looks.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 1, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      Ethan Frome    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Edith Wharton", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/126.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        37,665      ", "iid": "126", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//126/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Wharton, E.

Mattie Silver was the daughter of a cousin of Zenobia Frome\u2019s, who had inflamed his clan with mingled sentiments of envy and admiration by descending from the hills to Connecticut, where he had married a Stamford girl and succeeded to her father\u2019s thriving \u201cdrug\u201d business. Unhappily Orin Silver, a man of far-reaching aims, had died too soon to prove that the end justifies the means. His accounts revealed merely what the means had been; and these were such that it was fortunate for his wife and daughter that his books were examined only after his impressive funeral. His wife died of the disclosure, and Mattie, at twenty, was left alone to make her way on the fifty dollars obtained from the sale of her piano. For this purpose her equipment, though varied, was inadequate. She could trim a hat, make molasses candy, recite \u201cCurfew shall not ring to-night,\u201d and play \u201cThe Lost Chord\u201d and a pot-pourri from \u201cCarmen.\u201d When she tried to extend the field of her activities in the direction of stenography and book-keeping her health broke down, and six months on her feet behind the counter of a department store did not tend to restore it. Her nearest relations had been induced to place their savings in her father\u2019s hands, and though, after his death, they ungrudgingly acquitted themselves of the Christian duty of returning good for evil by giving his daughter all the advice at their disposal, they could hardly be expected to supplement it by material aid. But when Zenobia\u2019s doctor recommended her looking about for some one to help her with the house-work the clan instantly saw the chance of exacting a compensation from Mattie. Zenobia, though doubtful of the girl\u2019s efficiency, was tempted by the freedom to find fault without much risk of losing her; and so Mattie came to Starkfield.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 3, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      Ethan Frome    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Edith Wharton", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/126.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        37,665      ", "iid": "126", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//126/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Wharton, E.
