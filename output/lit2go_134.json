As the badger would collect and bring with it dried branches and dead leaves from the hills for firewood, the priest at last became very friendly with it, and got used to its company; so that if ever, as the night wore on, the badger did not arrive, he used to miss it, and wonder why it did not come. When the winter was over, and the springtime came at the end of the second month, the badger gave up its visits, and was no more seen; but, on the return of the winter, the beast resumed its old habit of coming to the hut. When this practice had gone on for ten years, one day the badger said to the priest, \u201cThrough your reverence\u2019s kindness for all these years, I have been able to pass the winter nights in comfort. Your favours are such that during all my life, and even after my death, I must remember them. What can I do to requite them?

Glad as I am to hear your kind intentions, there is nothing that I can ask you to do for me. You need feel no anxiety on my account. As long as I live, when the winter comes, you shall be welcome here.\u201d The badger, on hearing this, could not conceal its admiration of the depth of the old man\u2019s benevolence; but having so much to be grateful for, it felt hurt at not being able to requite it. As this subject was often renewed between them, the priest at last, touched by the goodness of the badger\u2019s heart, said: \u201cSince I have shaven my head, renounced the world, and forsaken the pleasures of this life, I have no desire to gratify, yet I own I should like to possess three riyos in gold. Food and raiment I receive by the favour of the villagers, so I take no heed for those things. Were I to die to-morrow, and attain my wish of being born again into the next world, the same kind folk have promised to meet and bury my body. Thus, although I have no other reason to wish for money, still if I had three riyos I would offer them up at some holy shrine, that masses and prayers might be said for me, whereby I might enter into salvation. Yet I would not get this money by violent or unlawful means; I only think of what might be if I had it. So you see, since you have expressed such kind feelings toward me, I have told you what is on my mind.\u201d When the priest had done speaking, the badger leant its head on one side with a puzzled and anxious look, so much so that the old man was sorry he had expressed a wish which seemed to give the beast trouble, and tried to retract what he had said. \u201cPosthumous honours, after all, are the wish of ordinary men. I, who am a priest, ought not to entertain such thoughts, or to want money; so pray pay no attention to what I have said;\u201d and the badger, feigning assent to what the priest had impressed upon it, returned to the hills as usual.", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 2, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        United States of America      ", "name": "      Stories from Around the World    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "FCIT", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/134.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        42,503      ", "iid": "134", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//134/", "source": "\nSource:\n      This book was compiled by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology and includes passages from multiple sources.

When I was at Peking, I saw a Chinese physician prescribe a decoction of three scorpions for a child struck down with fever; and on another occasion a groom of mine, suffering from dysentery, was treated with acupuncture of the tongue. The art of medicine would appear to be at the present time in China much in the state in which it existed in Europe in the sixteenth century, when the excretions and secretions of all manner of animals, saurians, and venomous snakes and insects, and even live bugs, were administered to patients. \u201cSome physicians,\u201d says Matthiolus, \u201cuse the ashes of scorpions, burnt alive, for retention caused by either renal or vesical calculi. But I have myself thoroughly experienced the utility of an oil I make myself, whereof scorpions form a very large portion of the ingredients. If only the region of the heart and all the pulses of the body be anointed with it, it will free the patients from the effects of all kinds of poisons taken by the mouth, corrosive ones excepted.\u201d Decoctions of Egyptian mummies were much commended, and often prescribed with due academical solemnity; and the bones of the human skull, pulverized and administered with oil, were used as a specific in cases of renal calculus.

The horse, having accomplished this feat, would have bolted off if he had not been stopped by a Peasant who was coming that way, driving a cow before him. Hans soon picked himself up on his legs, but he was terribly put out, and said to the countryman, \u201cThat is bad sport, that riding, especially when one mounts such a beast as that, which stumbles and throws one off so as to nearly break one\u2019s neck. I will never ride on that animal again. Commend me to your cow: one may walk behind her without any discomfort, and besides one has, every day for certain, milk, butter, and cheese.

He then called me to come and keep watch. I, too, asked him what the meaning of all this was. \u2018As you see,\u2019 said the tailor, \u2018the sculptor found time hang heavy on his hands and carved a damsel out of a log, and I for the same reason clothed her; and if you find time hanging on your hands, you can teach her to speak.\u2019 And by morning dawn I had actually taught her to speak.

France, crushed as flat as a bed-bug, straightened up. We were thirty thousand bare-feet against eighty thousand Austrian bullies, all fine men, well set-up. I see \u2018em now! But Napoleon\u2014he was then only Bonaparte\u2014he knew how to put the courage into us! We marched by night, and we marched by day; we slapped their faces at Montenotte, we thrashed them at Rivoli, Lodi, Arcole, Millesimo, and we never let \u2018em up. A soldier gets the taste of conquest. So Napoleon whirled round those Austrian generals, who didn\u2019t know where to poke themselves to get out of his way, and he pelted \u2018em well\u2014nipped off ten thousand men at a blow sometimes, by getting round them with fifteen hundred Frenchmen, and then he gleaned as he pleased. He took their cannon, their supplies, their money, their munitions, in short, all they had that was good to take. He fought them and beat them on the mountains, he drove them into the rivers and seas, he bit \u2018em in the air, he devoured \u2018em on the ground, and he lashed \u2018em everywhere. Hey! The grand army feathered itself well; for, d\u2019ye see the Emperor, who was a wit, called up the inhabitants and told them he was there to deliver them. So after that the natives lodged and cherished us; the women too, and very judicious they were. Now here\u2019s the end of it.

Such matters when they come to that pass, can\u2019t be settled without a great many battles; and, indeed, there was no scarcity of battles; there was fighting enough to please everybody.

{"section_text": "\n\t\u201cAnd Napoleon said, \u2018There, that\u2019s to be a kingdom.\u2019 And a kingdom it was. Ha! The good times! The colonels were generals; the generals, marshals; and the marshals, kings. There\u2019s one of \u2018em still on his throne, to prove it to Europe; but he\u2019s a Gascon and a traitor to France for keeping that crown; and he doesn\u2019t blush for shame as he ought to do, because crowns, don\u2019t you see, are made of gold. I who am speaking to you, I have seen, in Paris, eleven kings and a mob of princes surrounding Napoleon like the rays of the sun. You understand, of course, that every soldier had the chance to mount a throne, provided always he had the merit; so a corporal of the Guard was a sight to be looked at as he walked along, for each man had his share in the victory, and \u2018twas plainly set forth in the bulletin. What victories they were! Austerlitz, where the army manoeuvred as if on parade; Eylau, where we drowned the Russians in a lake, as though Napoleon had blown them into it with the breath of his mouth; Wagram, where the army fought for three days without grumbling. We won as many battles as there are saints in the calendar. It was proved then, beyond a doubt, that Napoleon had the sword of God in his scabbard. The soldiers were his friends; he made them his children; he looked after us, he saw that we had shoes, and shirts, and great-coats, and bread, and cartridges; but he always kept up his majesty; for, don\u2019t you see, \u2018twas his business to reign.

Remember these days, all of you, for \u2018twas then that Frenchmen were so particularly heroic that a good grenadier only lasted six months. We triumphed always; yet there were those English, in our rear, rousing revolts against us with their lies! No matter, we cut our way home through the whole pack of the nations.

Napoleon, in despair, threw himself three times before the cannon of the enemy without obtaining death. We saw that. The battle was lost.
