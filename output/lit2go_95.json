Another baby, when it sees a bright tea-pot, turns its head away and screams, and will not be pacified while the tea-pot is near.

The fact that is most prominent in his mind when he sees a tea-pot is the fact that he does not know whether it is hot or cold. He puts that fact along with the other fact:\u2014that he would very much like to play with the picture in the tea-pot supposing it would not burn his fingers; and he deals logically with both these facts; and comes to the wise conclusion that it would be best to go very cautiously and find out whether the tea-pot is hot, by putting his fingers near, but not too near.

{"section_text": "\n\tKeep always at hand, clearly written out, a good standard selection of the most important formul\u00e6\u2014Arithmetical, Algebraic, Geometric, and Trigonomet- rical, and accustom yourself to test your results by referring to it. These are the main laws of mathematical self-guidance. Once upon a time \u201cMoses\u201d pro jected them on to the magic-lantern screen of legislation. In that form they are known as the Ten Commandments; or, to change the metaphors, we might call the Ten Commandments the outer skin of the mathematical body. A great many people seem to suppose that, though everyone ought to keep the Ten Commandments, it does not matter what happens to one\u2019s mind. Just so, there are people who live unhealthy lives, and think they can make all right by putting cosmetics on their skin. But I hope you have learned in the hygiene class how stupid and futile all that is. The way to have a healthy skin is to grow it, by leading a hygienic life on a moderate allowance of pure wholesome food, and taking a proper amount of exercise in pure fresh air. People who do that with their minds grow the Ten Commandments naturally, just as Moses grew them. The world has been trying the other plan\u2014bad food and air inside, and cosmetics outside\u2014for at least 4000 years; and not much seems to have come of it yet. The Ten Commandments have not yet succeeded in getting themselves kept. Perhaps that is why some schoolmasters and mistresses think they would like to try the other plan now. Still, it is very good to have a normal model of what a healthy human being ought to look like outside. It is good to have a standard for reference. Therefore do not get too much immersed in the mere details of your own problems. Learn the Ten Commandments and a few other old standard formularies by heart, and repeat them every now and then. And say to yourself, \u201cIf I really am doing my algebra quite rightly, this (the standard formularies) is how I shall think and feel and wish. I shall wish to behave thus, not because anybody ordered me to do so, but from sheer liking and sense of the general fitness of things.\u201d", "__type__": "Section", "charpter": {"char_order": 6, "__type__": "Charpter", "char_mp3": null, "book": {"country_of_origin": "\n        England      ", "name": "      Philosophy and Fun of Algebra    ", "language": "\n        English      ", "author": "Mary Everest Boole", "cover_img": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/static/thumbnails/books/95.png", "__type__": "Book", "word_count": "\n        14,395      ", "iid": "95", "url": "http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go//95/", "source": "\nSource:\n      Boole, M.

But the angels do bring us very reliable information from a vast region of valuable truth about which most of us know very little as yet. They guide us how to frame our next provisional working hypothesis, how to choose the particular hypothesis which at our present stage of knowledge and development will be most illuminating for us.
